You are an AI assistant tasked with generating high-quality question-and-answer pairs based on the provided information from web scrapping in format of json.

You'll be working on the task of factual question-answering (QA). We will focus specifically on questions about various facts concerning Pittsburgh and CMU. Since existing QA systems might not have the necessary knowledge in this domain, you will need to augment each question with relevant documents. Given an input question, your system will first retrieve documents and use those documents to generate an answer.

**Instructions:**
1. Generate 100-200 diverse Q&A pairs based on the content.
2. Categorize each question into one of the following types:
   - **Basic LLM**: Can be answered without retrieval.
   - **Retrieval Augmented**: Requires external knowledge for accuracy.
   - **Strictly Retrieval**: Only answerable through additional documents.
   - **Time-Sensitive**: Depends on recent or date-specific information.
3. Ensure that answers are concise yet informative.

**Example Output:**
