      "and determination. We owe them a debt of gratitude for their efforts. Western\n",

      "In 1859 Edwin Drake was the first person in the world to apply well drilling technology\n",
      "to produce significant quantities of crude petroleum, at Titusville, Pennsylvania 1-8.\n",
      "However, it is a little known fact that Samuel Kier of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was the\n",
      "first person to refine crude oil by distillation, five years earlier than Drake’s discovery, in\n",
      "about 1854. Kier’s primary product was kerosene, a clean burning lamp fuel. In\n",

      "presented in Pittsburgh on August 26. Today’s extensive worldwide petroleum industry\n",
      "is a direct outgrowth of the efforts of Drake and Kier, first demonstrated in Western\n",
      "Pennsylvania.\n",
      "Early History of Petroleum\n",
      "Numerous ancient cultures, including Persians, Sumatrans and pre-Columbian Indians,\n",
      "believed that crude oil has medicinal properties. Marco Polo found it used in the Caspian\n",
      "Sea region to treat camels for mange, and the first oil exported from Venezuela, in 1539,\n",
      "was intended as a gout treatment for the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. In\n",
      "Mesopotamia around 4000 BC, uses other than medicinal included caulking for ships, a\n",
      "setting for jewels and mosaics, and an adhesive to secure well handles. The ancient\n",
      "Egyptians used it for embalming, and the walls of Babylon and the Pyramids were held\n",
      "together with it. The early history of petroleum is summarized by Williamson and Daum\n",
      "9, among others.\n",
      "As pointed out by Cadman 10, from ancient times there were only three major uses for\n",
      "crude petroleum: in construction as asphalt, in medicine, and to a limited degree for\n",
      "lighting and heating. This was the result of (1) the unique chemical and physical\n",
      "characteristics of petroleum and (2) the lack of suitable equipment for using it more\n",
      "effectively. These limitations were overcome by Samuel Kier’s development of\n",
      "petroleum refining, a single dramatic event. The resulting products made from petroleum\n",
      "could readily be utilized in a variety of applications, including lighting, powering\n",
      "manufacturing equipment, and fueling vehicles.\n",
      "Long before Drake’s accomplishment, petroleum (literally, “rock oil”) had been gathered\n",
      "at numerous natural seeps. The Seneca tribe of Native Americans, one of the tribes of the\n",
      "Iroquois Nation, used and traded seep oil for hundreds of years. It was collected in\n",
      "shallow pits; one method of recovery was to spread blankets over the oil, then wring out\n",
      "the blankets. The Seneca used the oil as salve, mosquito repellent, purge and tonic, as\n",
      "well as wigwam waterproofing, body paint, and for various religious practices. European\n",
      "explorers found about 2000 ceremonial troughs near Oil Creek in Venango County,\n",
      "Pennsylvania. In the early days, the product was called Seneca Oil, and was widely used\n",
      "for medicinal purposes such as treating sprains and rheumatism. A photograph in Time\n",
      "magazine for January 22, 2007 shows a man in Azerbaijan soaking in a tub of crude oil\n",
      "for therapeutic purposes, a practice still considered beneficial in that country.\n",
      "Some European settlers in Pennsylvania collected seep oil as early as 1792, using it for\n",
      "medicinal purposes, and local manufacturers used it to lubricate their machinery. Oil was\n",
      "recovered at the rate of a few gallons per day. Other than these uses, no major\n",
      "applications were found until petroleum could be refined.\n",
      "Western Pennsylvania has large underground brine deposits and had been an important\n",
      "supplier of salt since the 1790s. To access the brine, holes several hundred feet deep\n",
      "were dug by dropping a metal weight down a shaft, thereby crushing the rock and\n",
      "releasing the brine which flowed to the surface. A Pennsylvania Historical Marker was\n",
      "erected at Lawrence Corners, Crawford County, on PA Route 198, one mile east of the\n",
      "Ohio state line, commemorating an oil-producing salt well drilled by Samuel Magaw and\n",
      "William Clark in 1815 to recover brine for salt production 11. When the well was\n",
      "deepened to 300 feet in 1819, oil was struck. Because of this unwanted oil, the well and\n",
      "salt works were closed in 1821. This recovery of by-product oil from a salt well occurred\n",
      "some 40 years before Edwin Drake [Photo] drilled his oil well in1859.\n",
      "In 1845, Lewis Peterson of Tarentum, PA brought a petroleum sample to the Hope\n",
      "Cotton Factory in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, now Pittsburgh’s Northside. Morrison\n",
      "Foster and David Anderson of Hope Cotton combined petroleum with sperm oil to\n",
      "produce a better lubricant for the spindles, at a much lower cost. For ten years, this\n",
      "lubricant was used by Hope Cotton without the knowledge of anyone else 12.\n",
      "Samuel Kier (1813-1874) and the First Petroleum Still\n",
      "Samuel Martin Kier [Photo] was born near Livermore, Conemaugh Township, Indiana\n",
      "County, PA 13, 14, 15. His great-grandfather Andrew Kier had emigrated from Scotland\n",
      "to the Saltsburg area in the late 1700s. After a rudimentary education, Samuel Kier\n",
      "moved to Pittsburgh and entered the freight forwarding business. Although initially\n",
      "successful, he went bankrupt in the financial panic of 1837. He then reorganized the\n",
      "company as Kier, Royer and Co., which began operating flatboats that carried coal from\n",
      "Pittsburgh to Philadelphia via the Pennsylvania Canal.\n",
      "James Buchanan, who was to become the 15th President of the United States, joined\n",
      "Kier’s company in 1846. After canal transportation became obsolete with the\n",
      "development of the railroads, the company shifted to firebrick manufacture, iron and steel\n",
      "works, and coal mines. B.F. Jones, who also joined this venture, went on to become one\n",
      "of the founders of the Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, a major producer of steel in\n",
      "the 19th and 20th centuries.\n",
      "Kier’s father operated two salt wells near Tarentum, at about the present location of the\n",
      "PPG plant at Creighton. Petroleum was skimmed off before the brine was boiled down to\n",
      "produce crystalline salt. At times the unwanted petroleum was dumped into the nearby\n",
      "Pennsylvania Canal. Since the resulting oil slick frequently caught fire, this practice had\n",
      "to be abandoned.\n",
      "Prior to his work on distilling crude oil, Samuel Kier was already involved with\n",
      "promoting petroleum’s reputed therapeutic value 16. When his wife developed\n",
      "consumption, her doctor prescribed “American Medicinal Oil,” obtained from a well near\n",
      "Burkesville, KY. It is not clear whether this treatment was effective, but Samuel Kier\n",
      "thought that this oil was the same as the petroleum that was recovered from his salt wells.\n",
      "He was thus inspired to bottle and sell Rock Oil, beginning in Pittsburgh about 1847.\n",
      "Selling for 50 cents per half-pint bottle, it was advertised as a cure-all for internal and\n",
      "external application, treating rheumatism, gout, neuralgia, coughs, sprains, bruises, and\n",
      "many other conditions. One of Kier’s advertising circulars [Photo] claimed:\n",
      "• A remedy of wonderful efficacy\n",
      "• Lame would walk, blind could see\n",
      "• Cure for rheumatism, gout, neuralgia\n",
      "• Put up as it flows from the bosom of the earth, without anything added or taken\n",
      "from it\n",
      "Kier published another advertisement as a “Bank Note” in 1852 [Photo], which read:\n",
      "[Oil] “discovered in A.D. 1848 in boring for salt water near the Bank of the Allegheny\n",
      "River, in Allegheny County, Penns’a. about 400 feet below the earth’s surface, is pumped\n",
      "up with the salt water, floats on top, when a quantity accumulates, is drawn off into\n",
      "barrels, is bottled in its natural state without any preparation or admixture.” The Bank\n",
      "Notes showed two derricks as well as a battery of tanks used to produce and recover the\n",
      "oil.\n",
      "Yet another circular advertised “Kier’s Petroleum or Rock Oil, Celebrated for Its\n",
      "Wonderful Curative Powers. A Natural Remedy! Procured from a Well in Allegheny\n",
      "County, Pa., Four Hundred Feet Below the Earth’s Surface. Put Up and Sold by Samuel\n",
      "Kier, 363 Liberty Street, Pittsburg, Penn’a.\n",
      "The healthful balm, from Nature’s secret spring,\n",
      "The bloom of health, and life, to man will bring;\n",
      "As from her depths the magic liquid flows,\n",
      "To calm our sufferings, and assuage our woes.”\n",
      "Kier added to the circular the following statement: “Caution – As many persons are now\n",
      "going about and vending an article of a spurious character, calling it Petroleum, or Rock\n",
      "Oil, we would caution the public against all preparations bearing that name not having\n",
      "the name of S.M. Kier written on the label of the bottle.” This remedy was sold all over\n",
      "the Northeast by peddlers in highly decorated wagons, with about 50 sales agents at peak.\n",
      "Kier finally abandoned this sales approach because of high distribution costs, and started\n",
      "selling directly to pharmacies.\n",
      "George Bissell and the Concept of Drilling for Oil\n",
      "In 1853, Francis Brewer, MD, [Photo] a graduate of Dartmouth College living in\n",
      "Titusville, took a sample of seep oil skimmed from Oil Creek to the Chemistry\n",
      "Department at Dartmouth. George Bissell (1824-1888) [Photo] was a New York City\n",
      "lawyer who graduated from Dartmouth College in 1845. Around 1856, Bissell saw a\n",
      "Kier “Bank Note” in a drugstore window on Broadway, New York City. Shortly\n",
      "thereafter, when visiting Dartmouth, Bissell saw the petroleum sample that had been\n",
      "brought there by Francis Brewer and recognized its similarity to Kier’s Rock Oil 17.\n",
      "Bissell soon went to Titusville and leased 105 acres from Brewer for 99 years for $5000.\n",
      "This was the world’s first oil lease. In 1854, Bissell sent a petroleum sample to Prof.\n",
      "Benjamin Silliman, Jr. at Yale. Silliman recommended distilling crude oil to recover\n",
      "kerosene and other products such as paraffin and naphtha, and his report, projecting\n",
      "profitability, began to attract investors. Then it became clear that a dependable supply of\n",
      "oil was needed. As a result, Bissell organized the nation’s first oil company, the\n",
      "Pennsylvania Rock Oil Co., on December 30, 1854. This firm later was reorganized to\n",
      "form the Seneca Oil Co. In addition to Bissell’s entrepreneurship, a major contribution\n",
      "was the concept of drilling for oil, analogous to drilling for brine, an idea that was\n",
      "stimulated by Bissell’s seeing one of Kier’s Bank Notes.\n",
      "Edwin Drake and the First Oil Well\n",
      "Despite the fact that the drilling concept was generally treated with great skepticism,\n",
      "Bissell and his partners contracted with Edwin Drake (1819-1880) [Photo], a former\n",
      "railroad conductor and jack-of-all-trades, to drill for oil in the Oil Creek region. Under\n",
      "the auspices of the Seneca Oil Co., Drake went to Titusville in 1857. After\n",
      "experimenting with damming creeks and digging shafts in unsuccessful efforts to recover\n",
      "petroleum, Drake became convinced of the drilling concept. “Drake’s Folly” was the\n",
      "term used by the numerous skeptics in the area. Drake visited the Kier brine well at\n",
      "Tarentum, where he engaged the services of William “Uncle Billy” Smith [Photo], who\n",
      "was the Kier family’s salt well driller. After some hesitation, Smith went to Titusville\n",
      "and tackled the job. The rest is history. Smith successfully brought in the first oil well\n",
      "on August 27, 1859, using a 5-inch diameter iron pipe. The drilling apparatus consisted\n",
      "of a bit attached to the end of a rope, powered by a steam-driven windlass. The well was\n",
      "drilled to 69 ½ feet and yielded about 20 barrels per day.\n",
      "It should be noted that James Miller (1818-1890) actually drilled an oil well in Ontario,\n",
      "Canada about a year prior to Drake’s accomplishment. However, that project yielded\n",
      "limited quantities of crude and was quickly surpassed by Pennsylvania oil production.\n",
      "Edwin Drake was proud of his genealogy, including ancestors who fought in the\n",
      "Revolutionary War. Active in the local Episcopal Church, Drake became a respected\n",
      "citizen of Titusville. He did not patent the drilling technique that he promoted. By 1862,\n",
      "his health was failing and he was out of money. Diagnosed with muscular neuralgia, he\n",
      "spent his remaining years in an invalid chair. In 1873, the people of Titusville petitioned\n",
      "the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for a pension, which was granted. The $1500 annual\n",
      "stipend supported Drake until his death in 1880 and his widow until her death in 1916.\n",
      "The Drakes were buried in Woodlawn Cemetery, Titusville. The Drake Well Museum in\n",
      "Titusville has an excellent collection of implements used in the production and refining\n",
      "of crude oil.\n",
      "Edwin Drake’s vision and persistence enabled him to produce oil by drilling, despite\n",
      "widespread opposition and lack of support. Drake’s technological breakthrough, coupled\n",
      "with Kier’s pioneering efforts to refine crude oil, served as two major foundations of the\n",
      "modern oil business.\n",
      "While living in the oil region from 1859 to 1863, Bissell continued to invest in oil wells,\n",
      "a barrel factory, and a banking house, becoming quite wealthy. He returned to New York\n",
      "City in 1863, remaining active in the oil business and becoming President of the Peruvian\n",
      "Petroleum Co. Williamson and Daum provide an extensive summary of the Drake well\n",
      "discovery and related events 18.\n",
      "Kier’s Refinery -- First in Western Hemisphere\n",
      "Back in Pittsburgh, Samuel Kier had become interested in petroleum for uses other than\n",
      "medicinal, such as a lubricant, using it on machinery in various factories. He also sent a\n",
      "sample of crude oil to James Curtis Booth, Professor of Chemistry Applied to the Arts at\n",
      "the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. Booth had studied at the University of\n",
      "Pennsylvania and Rensselaer Polytechnic, continuing his studies in Europe. He spent\n",
      "1832-1835 working in the laboratories of Friedrich Wöhler in Göttingen and Gustav\n",
      "Magnus in Berlin, as well as studying chemistry at other locations in Germany and\n",
      "England. Booth’s courses on chemical analysis and industrial chemistry, given at the\n",
      "Franklin Institute in Philadelphia from 1836 on, were considered to be the finest in the\n",
      "United States. Booth established the first commercial chemical laboratory in this country\n",
      "in Philadelphia in 1836.\n",
      "Booth’s advice to Kier was to distill crude oil to produce an illuminant to serve as a\n",
      "replacement for whale oil, which had become scarce and expensive. Booth also provided\n",
      "Kier with drawings of a still. Based on this information, about 1854 Kier set up a\n",
      "wrought iron whiskey still of one barrel capacity, equipped with a condenser 19, 20, 21.\n",
      "This apparatus was located at Kier’s offices at 363 Liberty St. (now Liberty Ave.),\n",
      "Downtown Pittsburgh. Initially using as raw material the petroleum recovered from his\n",
      "father’s brine wells at Tarentum, Kier sold the liquid product as an illuminant, calling it\n",
      "“carbon oil.”\n",
      "An Improved Oil-Burning Lamp\n",
      "A significant problem developed: burning carbon oil in existing lamps used for coal oil\n",
      "and whale oil produced smoke and odor. To remedy this, Kier devised a lamp having a\n",
      "four-pronged holder for the wick that eliminated these problems, and he proceeded to\n",
      "manufacture and sell this lamp 22, 23, 24. [Photo] In time, demand for Kier’s lamp oil\n",
      "increased, as it was cheaper than the other available illuminants. Of course, the demand\n",
      "for oil-burning lamps was ultimately superseded by the invention of the incandescent\n",
      "electric light by Thomas Edison in 1879.\n",
      "Kier’s Expanded Refining Capacity\n",
      "Demand for carbon oil soon increased to the extent that Kier had to expand his operation\n",
      "to a larger scale. To achieve this, he built another wrought iron still [Photo], having a\n",
      "capacity of five barrels, housed in a one-story building about 12 x 24 ft. at Seventh\n",
      "Avenue and Grant Street in Pittsburgh, the present site of the U.S. Steel Building. This\n",
      "second-generation still, a cylinder measuring 42 inches in diameter and 56 inches in\n",
      "height, had thick circular top and bottom plates with a 12-inch hole cut into the top plate.\n",
      "This apparatus has been preserved and is displayed at the Drake Well Museum. Kier’s\n",
      "early refining operation is commemorated by a Pennsylvania Historical Marker [Photo]\n",
      "at the site of his operation.\n",
      "A.C. Ferris, a New York businessman, soon ordered a supply of carbon oil from Kier and\n",
      "began experimenting with its illumination potential. Responding to customer complaints\n",
      "regarding odor, Ferris adopted an additional refining step that consisted of washing with\n",
      "sulfuric acid followed by caustic soda. He sold about 1000 gallons of purified\n",
      "illuminating oil in 1858, cultivating markets that quickly made this product the nation’s\n",
      "most popular illuminant.\n",
      "Refining as practiced by Kier consisted primarily of distillation. Kier found that double\n",
      "distillation produced a much improved, lighter colored liquid. He produced about six\n",
      "barrels of distillate per day, which sold for $1.50 per gallon. Although this operation was\n",
      "profitable, competition soon arose from another source: coal oil (referred to above)\n",
      "distilled from coal by a process developed by Abraham Gesner in Canada and by James\n",
      "Young in Scotland. By the late 1850s, coal oil had become so plentiful and the price so\n",
      "reasonable that Kier’s relatively small scale production of petroleum based distillate\n",
      "could not compete. Coal oil was initially also known as kerosene, a term which\n",
      "ultimately was applied to petroleum-derived lamp oil. It should be noted that a major use\n",
      "of kerosene today is as jet fuel\n",
      "Relocation of Kier’s Refinery\n",
      "In addition to competition from coal oil, Kier faced the challenge of community\n",
      "complaints regarding odor and fire hazard at his Downtown operation. To comply with\n",
      "an 1861 ordinance, Kier moved the refinery outside the Pittsburgh city limits, to\n",
      "43rd St. (formerly Ewalt St.) at the Allegheny River, in Lawrenceville (now a part of\n",
      "Pittsburgh) 25. This installation, known as the Radiant Oil Works, was shown in\n",
      "Pittsburgh City directories, 1864-1865 and 1872, and continued to operate almost up to\n",
      "the time of Kier’s death in 1874. In the move from Downtown Pittsburgh to\n",
      "Lawrenceville, the original 1-barrel whiskey still was stolen and never recovered.\n",
      "Samuel Kier’s Final Days\n",
      "There is no remaining trace of Kier’s refinery. Despite his success in operating the\n",
      "western Hemisphere’s first petroleum refinery, Kier did not patent his petroleum still or\n",
      "his lamp. He earned little for his efforts in the oil business, though he was involved in a\n",
      "refinery at Freedom, Beaver County. He was, however, active in several other\n",
      "enterprises, pioneering in the manufacture of firebrick. Other interests included coal\n",
      "mining, pottery manufacture, insurance, and banking.\n",
      "Samuel Kier lived the rest of his life on 51st St. near Butler St., Lawrenceville. He was\n",

      "Samuel Kier can be credited with a major step in opening up the new field of petroleum,\n",
      "and particularly the refining industry. His advertising circulars were responsible for\n",
      "George Bissell’s inspiration to produce crude oil by drilling for it in salt formations.\n",
      "Through his pioneering efforts in petroleum distillation, he helped set the stage for the\n",
      "massive enterprise now known as the worldwide oil business. To quote W.K. Cadman 10,\n",
      "“It would be difficult to overestimate the importance of distillation in the history of\n",
      "petroleum; and the still is the heart of that vital process.” It is noteworthy that Kier’s\n",

      "Charles Lockhart and the World’s First Major Oil Refinery\n",
      "Another Pittsburgher who greatly expanded the scope and magnitude of the petroleum\n",
      "industry was Charles Lockhart [Photo], born in Scotland on August 2, 1818, the son of\n",
      "John Lockhart and Sarah Walker 26. Charles Lockhart emigrated to America with his\n",
      "family in June 1836. After first coming to Pittsburgh, where they sought a suitable\n",
      "farmstead, the family soon settled in Trumbull County, Ohio.\n",
      "Lockhart’s Early Days in Pittsburgh\n",
      "Charles Lockhart stayed in Pittsburgh, where he first worked as an errand boy, then as a\n",
      "clerk for James McCully, a Downtown merchant dealing in dry goods and produce.\n",
      "Lockhart stayed in McCully’s employ for 19 years. Along with fellow clerk William\n",
      "Frew, who was a nephew of McCully, Lockhart became a partner in the business in 1855.\n",
      "Isaac Huff of Tarentum was a supplier of salt to McCully. In 1852, Huff floated down\n",
      "the Allegheny River on a skiff carrying three barrels of crude oil, a by-product of the salt\n",
      "well of which he was a part owner. Appearing at McCully’s store, he was greeted by\n",
      "Charles Lockhart, who purchased the oil for 31 ¼ cents per gallon. Lockhart in turn sold\n",
      "the oil to Samuel Kier for refining, at 62 ½ cents per gallon. Lockhart contracted with\n",
      "Huff to purchase all the crude that he could produce for five years, at 31 ¼ cents per\n",
      "gallon. This was the first known instance of buying and selling crude oil in advance of\n",
      "production 27, 28.\n",
      "Once oil production began in the Titusville area, the crude was transported over a\n",
      "relatively short distance to what is now known as Oil City. From there, the Allegheny\n",
      "River provided a direct shipping route to Pittsburgh. Titusville is a little more than 100\n",
      "miles north of Pittsburgh. Shortly after the completion of Drake’s well, Lockhart and\n",
      "Frew, among many others, began producing crude oil in the Oil Creek area. Most of the\n",
      "crude was shipped to Pittsburgh, where it was initially refined by Samuel Kier for sale.\n",
      "Lockhart’s crude oil was the first oil from Oil Creek to come down the Allegheny River,\n",
      "and Kier was the first to distill it. The partners soon sank additional wells near Oil Creek.\n",
      "Lockhart claimed that while some others used divining rods to locate wells, his method\n",
      "was to simply insert a dry limb into a rotten stump, announcing that drilling should be\n",
      "done there.\n",
      "Lockhart’s Expanded Oil Business\n",
      "In May 1860, Lockhart sailed to England. Among his belongings were a gallon can of\n",
      "Pennsylvania crude oil and a gallon can of lamp oil produced as distillate from Kier’s\n",
      "refinery. While there, Lockhart successfully demonstrated lighting a lamp with the\n",
      "distillate. This signaled the beginning of international oil trading, now a major factor in\n",
      "the modern economy. In England, Charles Lockhart met Jane Walker of Scotland, and\n",
      "on his next trip in 1862 Charles married Jane. The couple returned to Pittsburgh, where\n",
      "Lockhart’s interests focused on the growing oil business.\n",
      "In 1861, Lockhart, Frew and partners built the first commercial scale oil refinery in the\n",
      "United States, at Brilliant Station on the south bank of the Allegheny River near Negley\n",
      "Run. This installation was on land originally part of the farm developed by the prominent\n",
      "Negley family but by then owned by James McCully. The refinery was named Brilliant\n",
      "Oil Works [Photo]. Cooling water, required for condensing the products obtained by\n",
      "distillation, was conveyed by gravity via pipeline from a reservoir, Lake Carnegie, in\n",
      "what is now Pittsburgh’s Highland Park. This lake was named in honor of Andrew\n",
      "Carnegie, the wealthy industrialist and philanthropist.\n",
      "Refinery capacity was 250 barrels/day. The technology used at Brilliant involved\n",
      "distillation, probably followed by treatment with caustic soda, sulfuric acid and finally\n",
      "water washing. The refinery is shown on Pittsburgh city maps of 1872, 1876, and 1882,\n",
      "but it was dismantled in the 1880s.\n",
      "In the lower left-hand corner of the Brilliant Oil Works photograph is a caption\n",

      "General Manager of the Imperial Refining Co., built in 1871 in Siverlyville (near Oil City\n",
      "PA) 28. Significant advances in early refining were attributed to Gracie; his name\n",
      "appears frequently in the literature of the first two decades of oil (1860s and 1870s) 29.\n",

      "By 1863, Lockhart & Frew had bought out the interests of their other partners and were\n",
      "buying up other refineries, owning seven refineries by 1872. At this time there were over\n",
      "60 refineries in the Pittsburgh area, and the business was plagued by excess capacity. In\n",
      "1865, Lockhart expanded his operation by building, in partnership with William Warden,\n",
      "the Atlantic Refinery in Philadelphia. This plant served to supply the overseas market\n",
      "with refined products.\n",
      "Formation of Standard Oil Company\n",
      "In 1872, Lockhart teamed with John D. Rockefeller and others to start the South\n",
      "Improvement Co., which was formed for the purpose of forcing out of business refiners\n",
      "who refused to join. This plan was defeated, as was a subsequent one. This group finally\n",
      "established the Standard Oil Co. Lockhart received Standard Oil stock in exchange for\n",
      "his seven refineries, and from 1874 to 1892, Lockhart served as President. The\n",
      "interaction between Lockhart and Rockefeller is detailed by Chernow 31.\n",
      "In 1879, Lockhart was indicted, along with other Standard Oil officials, for conspiracy to\n",
      "restrain trade. The case was settled out of court in 1880. Lockhart was named a Director\n",
      "of the Standard Oil Trust in 1882, and became President of Atlantic Refining Co. when\n",
      "the Trust was dissolved in 1892. Ida Tarbell, who grew up in Titusville, gives her\n",
      "version of the alleged monopoly practices of Standard Oil under Rockefeller in The\n",
      "History of the Standard Oil Company 32. A book commemorating the centennial of the\n",
      "Peoples Natural Gas Company 33 describes Standard Oil as a company “…that first saw\n",
      "the world as an integrated market, that had a continuing commitment to technical\n",
      "superiority, and that coordinated and unified all its functions.”\n",
      "Lockhart the Man\n",
      "According to John D. Rockefeller, Lockhart was “one of the most experienced, self-\n",
      "contained, and self-controlled men in business.” John McLaurin wrote 6 that “time has\n",
      "dealt gently with Mr. Lockhart, who is young in heart and sympathy and good-\n",
      "fellowship. His compliments have the juiciness of the peach, his pleasant jokes are\n",
      "spiced with originality, his years sit on him lightly and his old friends are not forgotten.\n",
      "He is happy in his social and business relations, in recalling the past and awaiting the\n",
      "future, in wealth gained worthily and enjoyed wisely and in a life crowded with\n",
      "usefulness and blessing.”\n",
      "In his oil industry activities, Charles Lockhart proved to be responsible for some\n",
      "significant innovations still practiced in the industry today. For example, when Lockhart\n",
      "encountered Isaac Huff of Tarentum in 1852 he contracted to purchase all the crude oil\n",
      "Huff could produce for five years. As mentioned previously, this was the first known\n",
      "instance of buying and selling oil that had not yet been produced. In addition, Lockhart\n",
      "initiated the international oil trade when he delivered a gallon of crude oil and a gallon of\n",
      "distillate to Great Britain in 1860.\n",
      "Although involved in the management of Standard Oil, Charles Lockhart diversified into\n",
      "other businesses, a number of which were in Pittsburgh, including:\n",
      "• Founder, American & Red Star Steamship Lines\n",
      "• Gold mining in Colorado and Idaho\n",

      "JZ: What did you think? Were you prepared to volunteer at this time or were you still\n",
      "in shock?\n",
      "RA: I wanted to go and volunteer for the Air Corps. I knew I was good in math and I\n",

      "crying and saying, “Wait until they call you, wait until they call you.” So I waited.\n",

      "RA: 1942.\n",
      "JZ: Do you remember the month and day?\n",
      "RA: I think it was December 1942.\n",
      "JZ: So during that year from Pearl Harbor until you were drafted were you still going\n",
      "to Pitt?\n",
      "RA: I was working. By that time we finished in Weirton and we were working in the\n",
      "ship yards in Ambridge where they built the LSTs.\n",

      "7\n",

      "there. He had a lot of brothers and his dad. His mother had already died.\n",
      "JZ: Tell me about your first day when you got drafted? I guess you got on the train\n",
      "and went down to Fort Meade. Tell me about that day.\n",
      "RA: Actually, we were on our way down to Fort Meade morning, afternoon or\n",
      "evening, going through the Rockies but some dumb guy busted the window in the\n",
      "train and most of us didn’t bring many clothes with us because we were going to\n",

      "came down from replacements overseas and away I went.\n",
      "JZ: You weren’t even done training?\n",
      "RA: No, I was done training but it was on the Long Toms. Then, they sent me to this\n",
      "artillery outfit.\n",
      "JZ: What is Long Tom?\n",
      "RA: They’re 155s field artillery.\n",
      "JZ: I guess you were transferred overseas?\n",
      "RA: So, I went into this outfit and the rest of my training had been on the Long Toms,\n",
      "but I went into that outfit anyway and they told me I was a truck driver.\n",
      "JZ: A truck driver?\n",
      "RA: I went up to the captain and I told him that there must be some mistake. I never\n",
      "drove a truck. He said to me, “Did you ever drive a car?” and I told him I had. He\n",
      "said, “Well it isn’t much different.”\n",
      "JZ: Oh, great.\n",
      "RA: I went overseas as a truck driver not knowing how to drive a truck.\n",
      "JZ: They just put you in wherever.\n",
      "9\n",
      "RA: The truck was carrying three and a half tons of ammunition and a machine gun on\n",
      "top of it and I had never operated a machine gun before. But I learned real quick.\n",
      "JZ: What year was this when you went overseas, 1943?\n",
      "RA: Yeah, 1943. I went to Africa first.\n",
      "JZ: You landed in Africa. Tell me about that trip.\n",

      "JZ: What did you do there?\n",
      "RA: Well, they had us mobilizing right away, dumping us, we were going up to the\n",
      "Kasserine Pass, but then Patton beat Rommel. They sent us back. We got ready\n",
      "for Sicily. We were going on hikes, up mountains, hiking primarily.\n",
      "JZ: I guess you were driving the truck and hiking the whole time?\n",
      "RA: I wasn’t driving the truck then, but when we got ready for the invasion of\n",
      "Sicily is when I started driving. I didn’t know how to shift gears.\n",
      "JZ: When did they invade Sicily? In late 1943?\n",
      "RA: July 10, 1943.\n",
      "JZ: I guess the day it was invaded you landed the same day?\n",
      "10\n",
      "RA: Yes, we landed in the sixth wave. It was about two hours from the initial invasion.\n",
      "JZ: Where in Sicily did you land?\n",
      "RA: In a place right outside of Agrigento.\n",
      "JZ: You were driving a truck? You were on board of the truck when they landed with\n",
      "the LSTs, is that it?\n",
      "RA: Yeah, they landed with two or three feet of water and that’s what I was afraid of,\n",
      "that I wouldn’t be able to get it on the beach but I did.\n",
      "JZ: You did. After you landed on the beach what did you do? Were you under fire?\n",
      "RA: Oh yes, it was a tough landing. We were under fire. I was pretty fortunate I had an\n",
      "angel on my shoulder. That was the second day. The first day we had a horrible\n",
      "experience. That night, these planes came in and we had orders to fire at them.\n",
      "They were firing at them and here they were B-25s, someone screwed up and\n",
      "didn’t give the pass and we knocked down about ten of them. Guys were cheering\n",
      "until we realized they were B-25s and then they were sick. We had a lot of\n",
      "machine gun mess in concrete bunkers. And all above us. And finally got hit….\n",
      "Hit them with their artillery and got rid of them. But then they … Like I said, I\n",
      "was very lucky I had an angel on my shoulder from surviving the German dive\n",
      "bombers took a....came down and was strafing. I used my machine gun and I hit\n",
      "that S.O.B. and I saw the plexi-glass shatter. Whether I downed it or not I don’t\n",
      "know but he dropped a bomb and I saw it. It was a 500 pound bomb. When I saw\n",
      "it coming down I thought my mother is going to feel awful bad. I had three and a\n",
      "half tons of ammunition. Here it came down but it hit four feet on the side of the\n",
      "truck. I was right by the water’s edge and water came up and hit me but the bomb\n",
      "never went off. I was just soaking wet. I was very lucky.\n",
      "11\n",
      "JZ: That’s a story.\n",
      "RA: The plane took off. I hit him. I might have wounded the pilot, I don’t know, but\n",
      "he took right off.\n",
      "JZ: That bomb never went off?\n",
      "RA: It never went off, thank God, or I wouldn’t be here. I saw him coming down and\n",
      "all I think was that my mom was going to feel awful bad.\n",
      "JZ: So it just happened in a couple seconds? No time to react?\n",
      "RA: No. Where was I going to go?\n",
      "JZ: That was right on the beach. What kind of gun were you firing?\n",
      "RA: A .50 caliber. I had to have a guy show me how to clean it because I had never\n",
      "operated the thing. I had to learn how to shift gears in the truck.\n",
      "JZ: Thank God for training, huh? Jeez. How long were you in that battle to invade?\n",
      "How long did it last?\n",
      "RA: It lasted about three days on the beach. We moved inland once they got rid of the\n",
      "machine gunners and we started after them. I will never forget the one night we\n",
      "pulled into this area after we first moved out. Boy, it had the worst smell. We laid\n",
      "in this field and went to sleep. When we woke up we were right at the cemetery\n",
      "next to the people. They had been bringing the bodies in. They had the bodies\n",
      "stacked one on top of another about eight feet high full of all dead people.\n",
      "JZ: Civilians?\n",
      "12\n",
      "RA: Yeah. They were all the Italians.\n",
      "JZ: Were most of the enemy soldiers Germans, or were they both Germans and `\n",
      "Italians at that time fighting the Americans?\n",
      "RA: Well, at that time they were both Italians and Germans. But then the Italians\n",
      "capitulated. We captured Sicily. Well, we went into Salerno. They announced\n",
      "that Italy had surrendered and capitulated. Thank God we could go right in...But,\n",
      "here the Germans were still there and had those 88s down on the beach. They\n",

      ".\n",

      "RA: I felt bad about it because you don’t know if you’re killing one of your relations.\n",
      "You know, you don’t know that. My father had always told me that he was from\n",
      "Messina and never went into details. Well, while we were waiting in Salerno I\n",
      "tried to get a pass so I could go see my grandfather in Messina. Well it was only\n",
      "60 or 70 miles, but there was no transportation so I never went. Here I found out\n",
      "that my Dad had misstated. Messina, Praiano is right outside Termini Imerese of\n",

      "JZ: Were you in Messina at all?\n",
      "13\n",
      "RA: When I was in Termini Imerese, I was right near the border near the state of\n",
      "Palermo and the state of Messina.\n",
      "JZ: After Sicily you went to Salerno? Did you do the same thing? Were you still the\n",
      "truck driver?\n",
      "RA: No, I finally got out of truck driving and got on one of the four .50 caliber\n",
      "machine guns. I was an operator on that. I also ran the power plant and portable\n",
      "generators.\n",
      "JZ: Oh, so you ran generators. What did you use that for specifically?\n",
      "RA: For electricity wherever we needed power.\n",
      "JZ: In the field?\n",
      "RA: Right.\n",
      "JZ: The electricity was for officer headquarters or MASH Units?\n",
      "RA: For whatever.\n",
      "JZ: Did you ever deal with civilians? What was it like dealing with them?\n",
      "RA: Once they found out that I was Italian they would invite you to their house and\n",
      "make spaghetti for you and this and that. I hated to eat because they didn’t have\n",
      "enough to eat themselves. One time I went to meet these couple of girls and they\n",
      "made spaghetti out of refined flour, real coarse. It was like putting sand in your\n",
      "mouth. I didn’t want to say anything because it would have been a big insult.\n",
      "14\n",
      "JZ: Did you speak a little Italian with them?\n",
      "RA: Oh, yes. I tried to talk to them as much as I could. I would give them soap if they\n",
      "had no soap or chocolates. Whatever. I gave them whatever I could.\n",
      "JZ: I’m sure they appreciated that. They had nothing.\n",
      "RA: Oh yeah.\n",
      "JZ: So after Salerno is when you went to Anzio?\n",
      "RA: First we went up to Caserta, Alto River, Cassino which was very bad.\n",
      "JZ: Oh, Mount Cassino. Tell me about that.\n",
      "RA: It was very bad. The Germans were firing down on us from the top of the\n",
      "mountain and we were down in the valley. It was pretty tough.\n",
      "JZ: At that time what were you doing?\n",
      "RA: At that time, I was on the 40 millimeter and the machine gun. They moved us\n",
      "around. We were what they called the “Bastard Battalion”. They moved us\n",
      "around wherever they wanted.\n",
      "JZ: What army were you in? You weren’t apart of “The Big Red 1” were you?\n",
      "RA: The Third Army. I went over with the 41st Division to Sicily, but there I was with\n",
      "the Third Army.\n",
      "15\n",
      "JZ: Tell me about combat. What are some of your combat experiences? Some other\n",
      "ones besides your guardian angel experiences. Tell me about some of your\n",
      "combat with the gun.\n",
      "RA: We had a tough time with…. When we hit Cassino, it was pretty bad. They pulled\n",
      "us out of there and we went back to Naples. We were guarding the harbor in\n",
      "Naples. We were at the Capo di Camo. That’s where I got a piece of shrapnel in\n",
      "my leg. We were at the king’s summer palace.\n",
      "JZ: In Naples. How did you get shrapnel in your leg? Showing off?\n",
      "RA: Well, the first night we were pulled back, we were so happy to get away from\n",
      "Cassino that this buddy of mine from New Jersey and I started drinking wine. We\n",
      "were half loaded when we got to Naples. That evening, our men... Long story\n",
      "really. We had a guy that in the states liked to drink up. “This is how you kill\n",
      "Germans.” And this and that. It got out of order and they had to send him home\n",
      "finally. He couldn’t stay in combat. Anyway, they kept getting closer and there\n",
      "was artillery bursts, guns were going off, and firing at the planes and the planes\n",
      "were firing. He & I were standing out instead of looking for a foxhole or\n",
      "something and a piece of shrapnel came at me and hit me in the leg. …We kept\n",
      "riding this guy. Oh, they’re getting closer, they’re getting closer. This guy dove\n",
      "& made a hole. Here the sanitation had been knocked out. The people had used it\n",
      "to crap in. It was loaded with crap and this guy went down in it. ………..\n",
      "JZ: It probably smelled so bad. How long did it take you to recover?\n",
      "RA: Oh I wasn’t hit that bad. It was just a piece of shrapnel. It was on the tail end. It\n",
      "burned a hole through my pants. It was right on the surface. It was on the tail end\n",
      "of the burst. And I was able to just pull them away from me. ….The wound\n",
      "almost healed itself.\n",
      "16\n",
      "JZ: After that I guess Anzio was next.\n",
      "RA: Right. We went up to Anzio. We were pretty fortunate. We landed at Anzio. We\n",
      "were only there for two days and then orders came and they shipped us to\n",
      "Sardinia to get ready for Southern France, Corsica.\n",
      "JZ: Oh wow, so you weren’t in Anzio for very long. Thank God.\n",
      "RA: No. In Corsica, we were guarding the airport.\n",
      "JZ: When you invaded Corsica, you were fighting the French or the Germans?\n",
      "RA: Nobody. We went right in. No one was there. No resistance.\n",
      "JZ: No resistance. Wow.\n",
      "RA: We set up an airport and that’s were the planes took off to bomb France and\n",
      "Germany.\n",
      "JZ: You said you went to Sardinia and then Corsica. How long were you there for?\n",
      "RA: I don’t remember exactly. Off hand, I would say maybe two or three months.\n",
      "JZ: Was it pretty much like R&R? Wasn’t dangerous or was it?\n",
      "RA: We had a couple air raids.\n",
      "JZ: The Germans trying to bomb. Did you try to shoot them down?\n",
      "RA: I don’t know. Fortunately I was damn lucky. My gun was…. I was on the multiple\n",
      "50’s. We were right at the gas dump when they invaded. ……Fortunately they\n",
      "17\n",
      "went right to the planes and not the gas dump. …..They knocked out about twenty\n",
      "of our planes that were on the ground. The next morning they pushed them planes\n",
      "to the side and new ones came in.\n",
      "JZ: How many planes did you ever shoot down? Did you ever tally?\n",
      "RA: The only one I personally can say was the Stuka, in Sicily\n",
      "JZ: Tell me about some of the weapons you used.\n",
      "RA: We used the small arm.30 caliber. The main thing was we used multiple .50s. The\n",
      "40 millimeter we operated when we were in the front.\n",
      "[End Tape 1, Side A]\n",
      "[Begin Tape 1, Side B]\n",
      "JZ; After Corsica you went to Southern France. Where did you land in Southern\n",
      "France?\n",
      "RA: We went into Marseille. We went right up, there was no resistance there. We\n",
      "went in I guess about…\n",
      "JZ: None? This was after D-Day?\n",
      "RA: Yeah, this was about ten days or one week after the invasion on D-Day.\n",
      "We went right up.\n",
      "JZ: You weren’t driving a truck were you?\n",
      "RA: No.\n",
      "18\n",
      "JZ: Where did you ride at? How did you get up there?\n",
      "RA: We went up with the truck. We would load the truck or jeep.\n",
      "JZ: After that?\n",
      "RA: We went to Avignon first. We kept moving ahead. We went up to Frankfurt,\n",
      "Germany.\n",
      "JZ: So I guess at that point you were starting to see more resistance?\n",
      "RA: Oh yeah. We were chasing them pretty good. By that time we started getting so\n",
      "many prisoners that they pulled us out and we went back to Versailles instead of\n",
      "putting a prisoner of war camp there. I was in charge of it. We had about 5,000\n",
      "German officers.\n",
      "JZ; So you were in charge. What was your rank at that time?\n",
      "RA: They always had me active when acting as sergeant. That means I was in active\n",
      "duty but I didn’t get the pay.\n",
      "JZ: Oh, duty but you didn’t get the pay. Back then it was all about the pay, they didn’t\n",
      "want to pay anyone. So you had 5,000 Germans and mostly officers.\n",
      "RA; Yeah, they were all officers.\n",
      "JZ: So they were tough guys, didn’t want to be there? Or they were kinda happy.\n",
      "RA: No, they were happy to be alive just like the rest of us. Then the war was over.\n",
      "19\n",
      "JZ: This was in Versailles you said?\n",
      "RA: It was right outside of Versailles.\n",
      "JZ: So it was a big camp. You put them in tents, barbed wire all around it. What did\n",
      "you do there? You said you were in charge.\n",
      "RA: We had eight sections and I was in charge of one of the sections. Different guys\n",
      "had different things.\n",
      "JZ: So how long were you in charge there, until the end of the war?\n",
      "RA: We pulled out and handed it over to the French. Then we went up to the big\n",
      "battle, Battle of the Bulge. We got the tail end of that. It was bad.\n",
      "JZ: You fought in the Bulge?\n",
      "RA: Yeah, and after that was over, they sent us to Brussels. We took over Brussels,\n",
      "Antwerp.\n",
      "JZ: What did you do there? Guard duty.\n",
      "RA: We were military police. They had a regular outfit there but they were stealing so\n",
      "much that they needed more people.\n",
      "JZ: What were they stealing? Anything & everything?\n",
      "RA: They were selling all the army stuff.\n",
      "JZ: Oh, they were selling army stuff to the civilians. What happened to those guys\n",
      "who were selling the goods? Were they arrested by the MPs?\n",
      "20\n",
      "RA: Well, I don’t know if they were able to prove who did what.\n",
      "JZ: You ended in Brussels at the end of the war. How were you on points? Were you\n",
      "getting ready to go to the Pacific?\n",
      "RA: Well that’s what we were going to have to do. At that time, they wanted us to re-\n",
      "enlist. But before that, they were going to send us home for a couple months and\n",
      "then go to the Pacific.\n",
      "JZ: You weren’t happy about going to Pacific were you?\n",
      "RA: I was glad to be going home for a little.\n",
      "JZ: Tell me about the medals over there. What are some of those medals and ribbons?\n",
      "RA: Well, that’s for different theaters and invasions. I know one was for meritorious\n",
      "combat.\n",
      "JZ: When did you find out about the war ending in Japan? Were you still in Europe\n",
      "when the war ended in Japan?\n",
      "RA: Yes, when we dropped the atom bomb in Japan. It makes me laugh today when\n",
      "people say we shouldn’t have ever done that. They estimated that we would have\n",
      "lost over a million men if we invaded Japan. They were already digging out caves.\n",
      "JZ: When were you finally discharged?\n",
      "RA: I got discharged in December, well no, I was discharged in January but I got\n",
      "home in December.\n",
      "21\n",
      "JZ: Of 1945. I guess looking back on it…What are some of your thoughts when you\n",
      "look back on your service in the Second World War? I guess it was every\n",
      "American’s duty at that time. Were you proud?\n",
      "RA: We just accepted it. We knew it was the right thing to do.\n",
      "JZ: You weren’t protesting. As an American of Italian decent how did it feel to go\n",
      "back to Sicily and Italy and free your ancestral homeland? Your Dad’s land.\n",
      "When you came back, did your father talk to you about what you saw in Italy? I\n",
      "guess he was concerned.\n",
      "RA: Oh yeah. They would send over all kinds of food and stuff over. Whatever they\n",
      "could. They would send back whatever they could, clothing, food.\n",
      "JZ: You went back to Italy?\n",
      "RA: Yeah, I went back.\n",
      "JZ: Did you see those places where you fought?\n",
      "RA: Yeah, I found some of them. I went back primarily to see my homeland, my dad’s\n",
      "and grandmother’s, which I did. In San Giovanni in Fiore, I found the church, the\n",
      "house she was born in and the church she went to. There were just a few distant\n",
      "relations there. Then I went to Sicily, to Palermo, and found my grandfather’s\n",
      "grave in the cemetery. My dad had a gang of brothers, but I didn’t find them; a lot\n",
      "of them moved. My one uncle went up to Palermo was the chief of police up\n",
      "there.\n",
      "JZ: After you came home, did you finish school? Did you finish at Pitt?\n",
      "22\n",
      "RA: I came back to Pittsburgh and started working. I went to school for one year, but\n",
      "going back to school after being in combat so I went to work. I had been studying\n",
      "engineering even prior and I was of the few guys that could read prints. Pretty\n",
      "early I became a general foreman to better myself. I was going to school at night\n",
      "and kept this one job down at J & L to put in a water house. I took it purposely\n",
      "because it was close and I could go to school at night but once I started there I\n",
      "guess after the second week or so, we started working a lot overtime. Six, seven\n",
      "days a week. I was making good money and at the meantime I was going to\n",
      "school at night. I didn’t have time to study to keep up with everything. I passed\n",
      "everything but I didn’t get out of it what I should have. That’s when I finally gave\n",
      "it up.\n",
      "JZ: You were a general foreman?\n",
      "RA: Yeah. I went with Dravo Corporation.\n",
      "JZ: And you stayed with that same company until you retired?\n",
      "RA: No, I stayed with them for about five years. Then I went with Eichleay\n",
      "Corporation. I joined the Carpenters Union. In fact, when I worked with my dad.\n",
      "The agent got sick, had a heart condition. A couple of guys came and asked me to\n",
      "run it. I figured, “Why not?” I took a crack at it. I first became business agent and\n",
      "then I became the business manager. I’ve been doing that for about forty years.\n",
      "JZ: Any final thoughts about your service in World War II or your generation and\n",
      "what they did for this country? Any final thoughts?\n",
      "RA; Yes, I’ve always regretted when we were in Sicily the Air Corps needed men and\n",
      "I volunteered for it, but the stinkin’ colonel didn’t like anyone to leave the outfit.\n",
      "When we got up into Italy, I took all kinds of tests. At that time, ironically, I had\n",
      "perfect vision and I was up on my math. I had Trig & Algebra. So, I kept asking,\n",
      "23\n",
      "“Did you ever hear from them?” What I felt bad about was we had another\n",
      "Jewish boy that graduated from Rutgers and they wanted him for aerial\n",
      "reconnaissance. They told him they would give him First Lieutenant right away.\n",
      "Never heard nothing from them. When we got on board ship to go Anzio and mail\n",
      "call came. They gave me my letters. Pass, Pass, Pass, then on the end, left the\n",
      "theater. We moved to another zone… so I couldn’t go. Son of a bitch. I had won\n",
      "the try out. I even felt bad of this Jewish boy, nice fellow. They offered him\n",
      "money, First Lieutenant, because he had graduated. They messed him up too.\n",
      "They screwed him too.\n",
      "JZ: Anything else? I would just like to say thank you for your service and what you\n",

      "CB: It was Saint Aloysius, but then they broke… and then when I got married I\n",
      "belonged to the Polish church, Saint Leocadia. And then when they broke Saint\n",
      "Leocadia church up, the majority of the parishioners, they could have gone to any\n",
      "church they wanted to but the majority of them went to Saint Jude the Apostle\n",
      "church now. See, they even changed the name of the Roman Catholic Church,\n",
      "from Saint Aloysius to Saint Jude.\n",
      "JZ: Was that a predominately Italian church, then, when you were growing up?\n",
      "CB: Well, we used to, yeah, I mean there was a mixture, like Irish, Polish… no the\n",
      "Polish had their own church down there. And then when I got married, I got\n",
      "married in a Polish church, and then I belonged, my wife and I, we belonged, was\n",
      "going to the Polish church. But that Saint Aloysius was all-denomination,\n",
      "Lithuanians, Croatians, Italians.\n",
      "JZ: Did everybody get along?\n",
      "CB: Very good, very good, yeah, they got along real good. You know normally, you\n",
      "don’t. I guess at that time they were all the same age group, and they knew what,\n",
      "hardship they had, you know, when they came over, and they know what the other\n",
      "nationality had so they… but they made the best of it though, they got along real\n",
      "good. I know a lot of Italian friends, they were real… These Lithuanian fellows,\n",
      "they took them into them, you know? They just… they liked them so much that\n",
      "they watched over them, like it was one of the families. But today everyone’s on\n",
      "their own. They’re not as close today as they were years ago.\n",
      "4\n",
      "JZ: So everybody, all the neighbors would get along?\n",
      "CB: Oh yeah, wonderful yeah. We never carried a key, the door was always open.\n",
      "Slept out on the porch, no one bothered us… today you got to have six or seven\n",
      "keys.\n",
      "JZ: And an alarm system…\n",
      "CB: Yeah…I mean, it’s, when somebody would bake something, they’d bring it to the\n",
      "house, like a cake or something, bring some of the cake over. Sometimes they’d\n",
      "bake the next one for the ones they want. And then when somebody got sick, the\n",
      "neighbors would go out behind that family of whoever was sick, and helped out.\n",
      "They stayed up with the kids, waiting or whatever with the person who was sick;\n",
      "take turns and stand up besides the mother and the father staying up. But they,\n",
      "they were real close, you know? It’s like one big happy family, the whole block.\n",
      "They helped one another.\n",
      "JZ: So this probably helped you get through the Depression?\n",
      "CB: Oh yeah, right. As a matter of fact, during the Depression the company provided\n",
      "a piece of ground for anyone who wanted to have a garden. And that they’d have\n",
      "free plants and then they’d go up and plant them. Like my dad, he used to work at\n",
      "Second Creek and I used to go up there and he told me, “Go up and make the\n",
      "rows.” So when he goes up there in the morning, all he’d do is plant it, and then\n",
      "there was like a stream of water, and you’d get the water from the stream and\n",
      "water the plants. He planted whatever we needed at the house, tomatoes, peppers,\n",
      "lettuce…\n",
      "JZ: So your house was right near the creek?\n",
      "CB: No. We had to go up in the hill.\n",
      "JZ: So you had a garden up in the hill?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, they had a lot of open field and they planned it off for anyone who wanted\n",
      "it.\n",
      "JZ: The Wilmerding government? Who gave you the piece of land?\n",
      "CB: I think the Air Brake had something to do with it.\n",
      "5\n",
      "JZ: And they gave you also the free plants?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, I mean we had to go down to one place that they had the plants. They’d tell\n",
      "you the plants are in. You’d get the plants, you’d get them, and you go up and\n",
      "plant them.\n",
      "JZ: Did your dad work during the Depression?\n",
      "CB: Yeah he did. They managed; they give a family, a fellow with a family like 3-4\n",
      "days a week, or 3, whatever it was. Sometimes he had to change shifts to get those\n",
      "2-3 days, whatever they gave them. But he liked second shift. He liked 3 pm -11\n",
      "pm. I don’t know why, but I guess he figured he could get something done. He’d\n",
      "get up early in the morning.\n",
      "JZ: Your dad make wine?\n",
      "CB: Yes, he made wine. Yeah, he made wine.\n",
      "JZ: How about your mom? What did your mom make and cook? Do you remember,\n",
      "any traditions, anything special?\n",
      "CB: Well I guess she made whatever the other Italian mothers made; they made cake\n",
      "from scratch, they didn’t have no box cake. We used to get like, pig’s blood free\n",
      "from the butcher, our neighborhood butcher. And she’d make those, like blood\n",
      "pudding. And to us it was like a delicatessen, it was something; we used to look\n",
      "forward to it, because we didn’t have money to go out and buy a cake. So it was\n",
      "like I told you, unless my mother made cake from scratch… and then she used to\n",
      "make her own macaronis, and used to eat macaronis twice, on Thursdays and\n",
      "Sundays, macaroni. She’d make it on Thursdays without the meat and then on\n",
      "Sundays with. [She’d] go to the butcher and get a piece of rump and she’d cut in\n",
      "small pieces so everyone in the family could get a taste of the meat on a Sunday.\n",
      "I guess, I mean, that’s about it. She did a lot of embroidering, my mother, yeah.\n",
      "JZ: Did she sell them, or would she just do it for the house?\n",
      "CB: You know, what we needed. She had a sewing machine. I guess every family\n",
      "seen a sewing machine, she used to use that to fix up the clothes, pants, whatever.\n",
      "Then after that, when she got older, she didn’t do it anymore. She did it whenever\n",
      "she was able to do it and then when she couldn’t do it she just gave it up.\n",
      "6\n",
      "JZ: Where did you go to school?\n",
      "CB: I went in the neighborhood, I went up to the, I think it was up to 4th grade, and\n",
      "then from 4th grade we had to come across town here, and go up to finish 8th\n",
      "grade. And then from 8th grade we used to go… Well, Wilmerding went to Turtle\n",
      "Creek High School, and then they finally built one in Wilmerding. I was the last\n",
      "group of people from up…we was the last group that graduated from Wilmerding\n",
      "High School, and then… no, I went to Turtle Creek. And then when they built the\n",
      "school, we were the last ones to graduate from Turtle Creek, but the ones after\n",
      "that, they started the school in Wilmerding. That was in ’37. I went there after we\n",
      "graduated our group; there was no one else who went to Turtle Creek and they\n",
      "went to Westinghouse Memorial High School in Wilmerding. And the ones from\n",
      "Wall, Pennsylvania, that’s the town right next to us, they used to go to North\n",
      "Braddock, Scott, and then after Wilmerding they built a high school and they\n",
      "came to Wilmerding.\n",
      "JZ: When you went to school as a kid, you spoke English at this time right?\n",
      "CB Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "JZ: So you didn’t have any problems with the teachers?\n",
      "CB: No, no problems at all.\n",
      "JZ: During the Depression, did you work at all? Did you help out your dad or, I know,\n",
      "you were at school at the same time, but did you help out? Do odd jobs?\n",
      "CB: Well, I remember selling papers. I used to sell, my brother sold for the Sun\n",
      "Telegraph. No, he delivered for the Sun Telegraph, he had a route, he used to go\n",
      "across town and then he’d go to Haderly [?], that was about ½ mile-mile down the\n",
      "road… no it was more than a mile, mile down the road. Then he had to go to the\n",
      "hospital, and then he was making more money than I was. I was making fifty\n",
      "cents a week selling papers up on the bridge at one of the gates at the\n",
      "Westinghouse Air Brake. I was selling the Press. Then after, like I said, he had to\n",
      "get operated on, I took that route job. I was making $2.50 a week delivering\n",
      "papers.\n",
      "JZ: The Sun Telegraph?\n",
      "7\n",
      "CB: Yeah, the Sun Telegraph. And then my dad, he managed, I mean, we never\n",
      "pressed him for anything. We realized he didn’t have much; he had a big family,\n",
      "five boys, two girls, and I mean, what he made he just had to make sure that the\n",
      "kids were fed and had some clothes on them.\n",
      "JZ: Were you the youngest?\n",
      "CB: No, no.\n",
      "JZ: Or, who was the oldest?\n",
      "CB: My oldest brother, his name was James. He was the oldest one. And then there\n",
      "was my other brother, he’s 92, 93, and then there’s my oldest sister, and then my\n",
      "brother Lou, and then me, and then my youngest brother; he passed away, and\n",
      "then my sister, youngest sister. So there are only three of us living.\n",
      "JZ: Did your dad ever serve in the military or anything?\n",
      "CB: No, no.\n",
      "JZ: So you graduated in ’37.\n",
      "CB: Yeah, in ’37.\n",
      "JZ: So after high school what did you do?\n",
      "CB: Well I got a job in the Air Brake, and I must have worked there about 6 months.\n",
      "And then I was called to go into the service. That was in ’41. And then from ’41, I\n",
      "didn’t come back, see, I was serviced. They had us on while we were in the\n",
      "service; when we came back to work, those 4-5 years that I wasn’t working, it\n",
      "added onto my service.\n",
      "JZ: So that has something to do with Social Security, right?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, they made sure, I mean I guess they told the fellows whenever you come\n",
      "back your job’s here, if you want to work here, and your service is added on to\n",
      "your, the time that you had before you went to the service.\n",
      "JZ: What did you do at the Air Brake?\n",
      "8\n",
      "CB: You’d start out with laboring. Then from laboring, when they’d allow new guys\n",
      "in, they’d go up to laboring, and that would move you up on the piecework job,\n",
      "like a machine, or a bench, or whatever it was. I got on the drill press, small drill\n",
      "press, and then when I left for the service, I left from that small drill press. And\n",
      "then when I come back, I work in the store room, because they wouldn’t let me…\n",
      "Well I mean, which was nice of them, they wouldn’t let me operate a machine\n",
      "anymore, on account of my eye. They thought maybe, when you’re drilling or\n",
      "something, you might lose the other one. I almost lost the other one the way it\n",
      "was; I got a piece of shrapnel right in between the nose and the eye, the right eye,\n",
      "the left eye’s gone. I had four shrapnels in my face. Above the eye, the eye,\n",
      "above the eye, cheek, and right by the right eye.\n",
      "JZ: I’m sorry. Did they take it out?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, I think I still got a piece in my head, cause I cant take no MCI or… you\n",
      "know, whatever that test, and then they found out. This one guy found out when\n",
      "he took an x-ray, found that I still had a piece of shrapnel in me. I had 19\n",
      "shrapnel wounds, I counted them one time when I was in the hospital, and I got\n",
      "from ’44 when I got hit, I got out on discharge, it was on VJ Day, when Japan\n",
      "surrendered. I was on my way home. So from, that was in ’45. I was in the\n",
      "hospital from ’43, when I got hurt, until ’45. I had 19, I figured about 19\n",
      "operations.\n",
      "JZ: So you were drafted in ’41?\n",
      "CB: Yeah. I tell everybody, I says, “Oh, you guys were drafted?” and I says, “I was\n",
      "selected.” You know, they called it the Selective Service Act, remember that’s\n",
      "what they called it. It's like the Service Act. I says I was selected to go, to come\n",
      "here (laughs). No, but I was a draftee though.\n",
      "JZ: So you were selected before Pearl Harbor?\n",
      "CB: Yeah.\n",
      "JZ: What month, do you remember?\n",
      "CB: I just forget what month it was. I think I was in basic, or the main camp. I really\n",
      "can’t remember what it was. But once they bombed Pearl Harbor they took\n",
      "precautionary measures. They put the machine guns up on the roof of the\n",
      "buildings in the camp I was in, and they made sure there were no lights on at\n",
      "9\n",
      "nighttime. When I left the States, we went right into action. We didn’t go to a\n",
      "country and sit around for a while. We went in right into action. We went to\n",
      "Africa right away.\n",
      "JZ: Operation Torch?\n",
      "CB: No, I just forget what it was called. There were 3 regiments in a division, each\n",
      "regiment was a combat team; they landed, one regiment landed in Casablanca, we\n",
      "landed in the north of Casablanca, and then there was land north of us. We landed\n",
      "in Port Lyautey and the other one landed in Oran. But that didn’t last too long,\n",
      "about 2-3 days, but a few of the fellows got killed at the beach there. And then\n",
      "when I got wounded it was around midnight, it was nighttime. And it was dark; I\n",
      "got shrapnel wounds from a German hand grenade. I don’t know how I got on the\n",
      "ground, whether I jumped off or whether I was blown off, because there was\n",
      "ammunition on the jeeps, small-man ammunition on the jeeps. The commander\n",
      "told me to show the jeep driver, I think he was from the ammunition one. He says,\n",
      "“Take the jeep driver up to your company area,” and we never got there with the\n",
      "ammunition because we was blown up. Then from there I was on the ground.\n",
      "While I’m crawling to go to the company, he’s lying where the company was, the\n",
      "German patrol, they got around, happened to look up and I seen him, and I guess\n",
      "they seen I wasn’t gonna last too long, with all the blood coming from my face\n",
      "from the four shrapnel wounds. So they just left and I just kept crawling. But I got\n",
      "there, and told my, I think it was the sergeant, he says, “He get you too?” I says\n",
      "“Yeah German patrol, not through our lines.” I says “That’s who did it.” I\n",
      "understand that they got the patrol after I had notified them that I had seen them,\n",
      "and that’s who it was. I passed out as soon as I got to the line, and then I come to.\n",
      "And then until about dawn, they brought me back to the company headquarters, to\n",
      "CP, and they says, I think it was the officers, he says, “Why did it take so long to\n",
      "bring him back?” They said that they thought it was more than one patrol that’s\n",
      "not through our line. Then I passed out, and I don’t think I came to until about 11\n",
      "days later. After that morning, when they was taking me to the field hospitals, and\n",
      "the evacuation hospital, then I stayed in a couple hospitals in the buildings. I was\n",
      "in Casablanca, I was in a hospital in Casablanca, and then I guess from there they\n",
      "moved me back to the states.\n",
      "JZ: So this was in the desert, right?\n",
      "CB No, it was up in the hills of Meknassy.\n",
      "JZ: In Tunisia?\n",
      "10\n",
      "CB: Yeah, in Tunisia, where I was hit. Like I says, I can’t remember. I knew I was on\n",
      "the ground. But I don’t know whether I jumped off or whether I was blown off. I\n",
      "just kept crawling.\n",
      "JZ: Were you with anybody in the jeep?\n",
      "CB: Yeah the jeep driver. But I don’t know who he was or nothing. We never got to\n",
      "get into a good conversation, who he was, what his name was, and he must have\n",
      "come from the ammunition corps, because when they called in… see because they\n",
      "was using a lot of small arms ammunition to let the Germans know that the\n",
      "Americans were opposite them, and they must have been using an awful lot of\n",
      "them, then they wanted more ammunition, because they didn’t want to be caught\n",
      "short. Them soldiers at that time, we had one Italian soldier, he was a sergeant, he\n",
      "made… all our officers were gone, they were shot, and he took over the\n",
      "command. He wound up making commission, field commission. He made it from\n",
      "the field from what he did out on the battlefield. And when you make it that way,\n",
      "you’re making a commission the hard way. He just come in. We had one sergeant.\n",
      "He was from the ammunition company. When we landed in Port Lyautey, we was\n",
      "going up towards the fort, I happened to see this one fellow. He says, “What’s he\n",
      "doing up here?” Here, he was a sergeant from the ammunition company giving us\n",
      "our ammunition. Somebody spoke up, he says, “He couldn’t give out the\n",
      "ammunition; he had to be where the action was. He took it out on his own to go\n",
      "and fight.” That’s the kind of soldiers we had. When they thought they wasn’t\n",
      "doing enough, they wanted to go do more. Maybe today if he had not been on this\n",
      "job, maybe he’d still been living all these years. But he just…\n",
      "JZ: So it was like D-Day, you guys landed in Morocco, right?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, we landed. Well we left into state and we went right to action.\n",
      "JZ: Right into action?\n",
      "CB: Right into action from the States. It was an awful lot of ships, because every time\n",
      "we’d wake up in the morning, we’d see ships, more ships than we had the day\n",
      "before, and then the next morning the same thing. We went in by landing barges,\n",
      "and then I was fortunate enough to be in the first wave because there wasn’t any\n",
      "shooting at the time. But the ones who came in after us, they got the worst; there\n",
      "was a few of them dead down on the beach. I think we had twin brothers who\n",
      "were killed at the time when we landed.\n",
      "11\n",
      "JZ: Were there Germans in Morocco at that time? Who was there?\n",
      "CB: No, I think the French. We got the Germans later. I think the French. But they\n",
      "didn’t give us no resistance. We was always on the go. We never went and took a\n",
      "rest in a building; we always rested in a pup tent. You know, we’d put our pup\n",
      "tents up, rest, and then we’d keep going. We’d keep going forward, going ahead,\n",
      "but the French, to me, they didn’t want to fight. They gave up right away. But the\n",
      "Germans, then when we came close to where the Germans were, then there was a\n",
      "pretty….\n",
      "JZ: Were there Germans and Italians, or just all Germans?\n",
      "CB: Even Italians didn’t want to fight, there was Italians too, there was Italians there.\n",
      "JZ: You remember seeing them?\n",
      "CB: We saw where they was at, but when we went to where they was, where they\n",
      "were positioned at, they weren’t there. They had left. One of the sergeants said\n",
      "there were Italians here. I guess they ran. They didn’t want to have nothing here.\n",
      "JZ: So you were in the infantry, right?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, right.\n",
      "JZ: So when you were drafted in ’41, you left Pittsburgh. Where did you go after you\n",
      "left Pittsburgh?\n",
      "CB: I went to the basic camp. That was in Camp Wheeler, Georgia. Then from Camp\n",
      "Wheeler, Georgia, where they had the basic training, I went to Fort Bragg, North\n",
      "Carolina. They had the 9th Infantry Division there. The home base was there, and\n",
      "then there was the 82nd Airborne was based there. Then there was an artillery\n",
      "outpost there. And then there was one area, there was a friend of mine, he was in\n",
      "the 2nd Armored, and they were, about, maybe 5 miles down the road. And when I\n",
      "heard that they were 5 miles down the road, then I knew he was in the 2nd\n",
      "Armored Division. I went down to see him, and they were getting ready, they\n",
      "were getting ready to go overseas too.\n",
      "JZ: Tell me about basic training. What did you do there?\n",
      "12\n",
      "CB: They showed you how to use your rifle, you know, how to be a soldier; in other\n",
      "words, no fooling around and all that. We ran every morning, did calisthenics in\n",
      "the morning, and went on the hikes, 15-mile hikes. And then we went to Fort\n",
      "Bragg. They made us walk ¼ mile, run ¼ mile because somebody told us that the\n",
      "reason they was doing that was because the beach that we was gonna land on was\n",
      "a long beach, and they wanted us to be in shape. We did that oh, about every day.\n",
      "We’d run ¼ mile, walk ¼ mile, run ¼ mile, walk ¼ mile. But there was a lot of\n",
      "guys, during the first ¼ of a mile of the run, they’d step on the side [of their foot]\n",
      "so they couldn’t go on any more. But they wound up going overseas with us\n",
      "anyways. They just didn’t want to run anymore. Then the trucks would come and\n",
      "pick them up and take them back to camp.\n",
      "JZ: So you were training, and you knew you were going to end up on a beach?\n",
      "CB: Yeah.\n",
      "JZ: And they told you that?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, because they told us, “We got to keep you in shape to get ready when you\n",
      "make the invasion.”\n",
      "JZ: What division, you were the 9th?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, 9th Infantry Division.\n",
      "JZ: What’d you do for fun on the weekends or on leave?\n",
      "CB: Oh, we’d just rest up, get together, start BS-ing, that’s about all. All of them used\n",
      "to go to town. They used to go to Raleigh, North Carolina from Fort Bragg. I\n",
      "never went.\n",
      "JZ: Stay around the base?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, the camp, you know. Go down to the day room and BS sometimes.\n",
      "Sometime go to the movies on the post.\n",
      "JZ: How was the food?\n",
      "CB: Food was very good, very good. And on Saturdays, we didn’t have to get up to\n",
      "do any work, do like calisthenics or anything like that… or was that Sunday?\n",
      "13\n",
      "Well, anyway, either Saturday or Sunday, the fellows they were… they loved to\n",
      "eat. They used to go to the mess hall, and when they’d come back we’d ask them\n",
      "what they had and if it were anything worth while getting up for. We used to get\n",
      "up, because otherwise, we’d stay in bed. I think that was on a Sunday. Well, when\n",
      "they had good breakfast, we got up and went. But when the breakfast, we didn’t\n",
      "care for it, we didn’t go. We’d stay in bed. And they would go up to the PX and\n",
      "have something to eat. Well then there was lunch time, when people would eat\n",
      "lunch and dinner.\n",
      "JZ: How did you get along with the other guys?\n",
      "CB: Good.\n",
      "JZ: You didn’t have any problems because of your Italian descent?\n",
      "CB: No, no, no, no, no problem. Hey like I says, we was all there for one purpose: to\n",
      "be a soldier and fight whoever we was supposed to fight. This one fellow… they\n",
      "was sending fellows home, before we went overseas; he had a chance to go home.\n",
      "And this one guy was down in the orderly room, and he knew there was room for\n",
      "one more, and he knew that I hadn’t been home yet. So I’m walking down the\n",
      "company street going towards the… was that? Yeah, I was walking down, and he\n",
      "was coming up. And he says, “Hey Botti! They’re going to call you and ask you if\n",
      "you would like to go home on a furlough week.” Hey says, “I know you don’t\n",
      "have any money; tell them you’ve got the money, tell them yeah.” He says, “I’ll\n",
      "get it for you.” And he got it for me. He was a Jew fellow from Chicago. He\n",
      "happened to give me enough, so much that when I came home, I got him, and\n",
      "when I got back, I gave it back to him. I mean that’s how they were, they helped\n",
      "one another out.\n",
      "JZ: Very nice. So you came home for a couple days?\n",
      "CB: About five days or a week I think it was. Whatever time they gave me, it went\n",
      "real fast and I just, if it wasn’t for that fellow I probably would have never got\n",
      "home, you know. I mean we left in ’41, and ’45, that’s when I come back. But\n",
      "once you’re overseas in the service, you don’t know what day it is, what month,\n",
      "what time of the day, because we’re not interested in that. Time don’t mean\n",
      "nothing. When they told you to get up, we got up. When they told us it was chow,\n",
      "we figured it was around lunchtime. But we never kept track of the days like we\n",
      "do here, like March today, or whatever. They never talked about the days, or\n",
      "weeks, or months, or whatever.\n",
      "14\n",
      "JZ: So what kind of equipment did you have? Of course you had your M-1…\n",
      "CB: Oh yeah, you had an M-1. You had a bayonet. Then you had a pup tent. You had\n",
      "to carry it with you, and blankets. That was like a full-filled pack. A mess kit; you\n",
      "had one for the food and one for the water.\n",
      "JZ: I guess the pack was quite heavy.\n",
      "CB: Yeah, it was heavy.\n",
      "JZ: So when you were going to Morocco, you left from Fort Bragg or did you go up\n",
      "the… did you leave from a port up there?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, let’s see… was it Norfolk, Virginia? I think it was from Norfolk, Virginia.\n",
      "Like I says, I didn’t pay much attention to all those things, you know, like where\n",
      "we left from, the name of the ship was and all that.\n",
      "JZ: You were just taking it day by day.\n",
      "CB: That’s right, day by day. Yeah, we went straight over, and went right into action\n",
      "from the states.\n",
      "JZ: Excuse me, we’re gonna take a little break.\n",
      "CB: That’s fine.\n",
      "[End Tape 1, Side A]\n",
      "[Begin Tape 1, Side B]\n",
      "JZ: So you went to Macon, Georgia for the basic?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, Camp Wheeler, Georgia.\n",
      "JZ: So, how was, real brief, when you were in Morocco, how was the local\n",
      "population, like the civilians in Morocco?\n",
      "CB: Well, they told us they didn’t want one person to go by themselves. They says to\n",
      "make sure you have somebody with you because they never knew what was\n",
      "15\n",
      "gonna happen. They see one guy, whatever the Moroccans were gonna do. But\n",
      "like I says, I mean, we didn’t spend any time, I think, in town, because we was\n",
      "always on the move. Our outfit was always on the move. We used to see them, as\n",
      "soon as we’d move out of our bivouac area. Then we’d see the Moroccans come\n",
      "over and then they would dig up the ground where we had threw our garbage and\n",
      "clean up cause they’d dig it up and get what they could salvage from it, you\n",
      "know? That’s the only time we’d seen what the Moroccans did. But, like I says, in\n",
      "town, we never stayed around too long to go into town, because we was always\n",
      "on the go.\n",
      "JZ: You were always on the go?\n",
      "CB: Oh yeah, always on the move.\n",
      "JZ: This was all desert, right?\n",
      "CB: No, it wasn’t desert, mountainous, hills, a lot of hills, mountainous. We used to\n",
      "see a lot of Moroccans out in the hills, you know. But they never bothered us.\n",
      "JZ: They never said much?\n",
      "CB: No, nothing. We just kept going. And then I, during the day, we had those army\n",
      "coats. A lot of the fellows would throw their coats away because it was too heavy\n",
      "for them to carry when it was warm. But they could have used them at night\n",
      "because the nights were cool. But they were sorry afterwards that they threw their\n",
      "coats away.\n",
      "JZ: So a lot of guys, did they get rid of some of their equipment on their…\n",
      "CB: Yeah, but not the main equipment, they got rid of the, the coats, the things that\n",
      "they didn’t need.\n",
      "JZ: So like you said, not a lot of resistance up until Tunisia.\n",
      "CB: Yeah, up there.\n",
      "JZ: So like you said, afterwards, you came home, you came back here to…\n",
      "CB: In 1945 I came back.\n",
      "16\n",
      "JZ: After you were wounded you went to…\n",
      "CB: I went to different hospitals, yeah. Field hospitals, evacuation hospital, and then I\n",
      "went to Casablanca; I think they moved me up to Oran. Then we left from there,\n",
      "came back on the ship and went to Fort Dix in New Jersey, Tilton General\n",
      "Hospital. I forget how many months I was there, or years. Then I went to Staten\n",
      "Island, New York. I think I was operated on in Tilton. I saw a fellow’s stomach,\n",
      "in Fort Dix, in Jersey; he had a hole like this in this stomach. I used to go see him\n",
      "everyday, but then afterwards, I didn’t get to see him. I think they moved me out.\n",
      "I don’t know whether he lived or not. That penicillin came out during the war too.\n",
      "When I was in the hospital, I happened to see a lot of nurses and doctors around\n",
      "patients; I told them nurses, “What are they doing there? I see a lot of commotion\n",
      "going on.” They said that they were trying a new medicine. It’s called penicillin.\n",
      "They’d give it to a patient. They never gave it to them twice in the same spot.\n",
      "They give it on the cheek, on the arm, on the next arm, shoulder, and then the\n",
      "other cheek. Then they’d go around, because they didn’t know what kind of affect\n",
      "that penicillin… but it was a wonder drug, a wonder drug. And that’s what they\n",
      "tested on these patients. And then they finally wound up giving you, that was like\n",
      "a powder form, they had like a powder form. I think they wound up making it in\n",
      "liquid in which they gave you a shot. I think they had a powder form, from what I\n",
      "understand. Powder form and then the needle.\n",
      "JZ: Did you get a lot of shots when you were going overseas?\n",
      "CB: I can remember maybe one or two shots. Maybe one, they had to give you shots.\n",
      "When you go to another country, they had to give you something. Or either that or\n",
      "pills; they used to give pills too, I guess. I think on the ship, I remember, I think\n",
      "the officer was asking this one soldier if he had got a certain kind of pill, and I\n",
      "don’t remember whether he says yes or no.\n",
      "JZ: So tell me about when you were told you were going to get the Distinguished\n",
      "Service Cross in the hospital room.\n",
      "CB: Well, the nurse, like I said, she was more excited than I was. She made sure that I\n",
      "had hospital clothing on. I went down with hospital clothes. She made sure that I\n",
      "was cleaned up and everything. And we went down to the hospital ground outside\n",
      "and there was a little service there; to me it was just a small service. They\n",
      "presented me with the Distinguished Service Cross. And I got it and brought it up\n",
      "to my room, and I guess maybe the next day or the same day, I don’t know, I had\n",
      "to send it out for them to get it at home. You know, you’re young, 22, 23, 24\n",
      "17\n",
      "years old, what do you know about certain things in the army. A medal, you\n",
      "figure, is just another medal, but I didn’t realize that there was a Distinguished\n",
      "Service Cross that was the second highest. When I got the Purple Heart, it was\n",
      "just the Purple Heart. You get that when you’re wounded. Then they give you\n",
      "Infantry Badge with a rifle on it. Combat Infantry Badge – that was another\n",
      "medal. They just gave it to you, put it on the side. Then when I sent the other\n",
      "ones home, I sent that one too.\n",
      "JZ: Who presented it to you? Was there a general or…\n",
      "CB: I don’t know who handed it out at the hospital. Like I says, all I remember was, I\n",
      "was out on these grounds, the hospital grounds, and there was a few people\n",
      "around. Maybe a lot, I can’t remember whether it was a lot or a few, but they\n",
      "presented me with this Distinguished Service Cross.\n",
      "JZ: This was in ’44?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, in ’44. I got that in ’44.\n",
      "JZ: And so it was VJ Day when you went home from the hospital?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, that’s when they discharged me. They figured there was nothing more they\n",
      "could do for me, so they gave me a discharge. But I was in the hospital from ’43\n",
      "up to ’45.\n",
      "JZ: How many total operations?\n",
      "CB: I figured about 19 operations I had.\n",
      "JZ: Nineteen? And that was mostly to remove the shrapnel?\n",
      "CB: My eye was pretty bad; they were trying to fix it up where they could put a glass\n",
      "eye in there. There was a lot of operation on the eye. And like I says, they cut this\n",
      "up. I remember afterwards they thought they took everything out, and pus was\n",
      "coming out. They figured there was more shrapnel in there, so they cut it open\n",
      "again, and cleaned it all out. Up here, they did some skin grafts by the eye, right\n",
      "up here by the eye. They did some skin graft there. They took a lot of skin grafts\n",
      "from my arm here, skin, and put it in the eye to make it soft. I guess the eye was\n",
      "the main thing that the operation was for. They used to give me ether. When I got\n",
      "ether, I used to get sick as hell.\n",
      "18\n",
      "JZ: And that’s… alcohol?\n",
      "CB: No, yeah, ether, during the operation, but then they used to give me an\n",
      "intravenous, and I never got sick; there was no after-effects after that. So when I\n",
      "used to know I would be getting operated on, I’d go in the nurses office and I’d\n",
      "see my name. I’m getting operated on and I’d see what they were going to give\n",
      "me. And if I’d seen ether, I’d go seen the doctor. I says, “Can you give me\n",
      "intravenous instead of ether? The ether gets me sick.” And then they told me the\n",
      "ether, it all depends on the length of the operation, that’s when they use the same\n",
      "thing with the penicillin. There was a length of time that the operation needed;\n",
      "they used to give me ether, the same with the penicillin. But I think I only got\n",
      "ether once or twice, and the rest of the time I got intravenous. But that was, there\n",
      "was no sickness. I used to get sick, throw up from that ether. Oh my.\n",
      "JZ: Did anyone from your family…\n",
      "CB: Yeah my dad came. My father came to see me up in Fort Dix. He came by\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "JZ: Did your brothers serve too?\n",
      "CB: No. No. I had. Well I used to, when I was able to get around. I went to see some,\n",
      "they said they claimed there were relatives of mine in New Jersey. It wasn’t too\n",
      "far from Fort Dix.\n",
      "JZ: What was your rank?\n",
      "CB: When I left, it was PFC, Private First Class.\n",
      "JZ: So after you came back, you remember hearing around VJ Day, and the atomic\n",
      "bomb, or anything else about the war being over?\n",
      "CB: I’m pretty sure… we heard about the atomic bomb. I think I was still in the\n",
      "service at the time when they threw the bomb in Hiroshima or whatever that\n",
      "island in Japan or… I knew when I left, even soon as I left camp to come home, I\n",
      "already knew that Japan had surrendered. The news was out at the time.\n",
      "JZ: Whatever happened to the 9th Infantry Division? Did they keep going?\n",
      "19\n",
      "CB: Oh yeah, they kept going. I mean after the invasion of Africa, understand, they\n",
      "were made the 9th Division again. They got together and they start moving up; I\n",
      "don’t know, I never kept track where they went after that. They probably went to\n",
      "Italy, or probably went to France. I mean I don’t know.\n",
      "JZ: So when you came back, what did you do after you went back to Westinghouse?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, I went back to Westinghouse to work. I had a fellow from Wilmerding, he\n",
      "was in another regiment, he was captured by the Germans. He’s dead now though.\n",
      "I think he, we left the same time. He was in the 39th, I think, regiment. I was in the\n",
      "60th. Then it was like the 47th too was another regiment in our division.\n",
      "JZ: When you came back did you mention the Distinguished Service Award?\n",
      "CB: No. I didn’t mention nothing. I had even forgotten about it. I had sent it back; I\n",
      "thought it was just like another medal. I didn’t mention it to nobody until…maybe\n",
      "I did mention it to one person, maybe years ago, but I don’t remember. When\n",
      "fellows would talk about their experience in the service, I just never said\n",
      "anything. I just listened to what they had to say and that was it. I think maybe\n",
      "about 3 years ago, I thought it’s about time that I let it out that I got a medal.\n",
      "JZ: You just didn’t want to talk about it and keep it to yourself?\n",
      "CB: Yeah. If anybody says, “What’s the reason why you just come out?” I says,\n",
      "whatever you say it is, that’s what it is. Because I just didn’t. I don’t know why I\n",
      "didn’t mention years ago. I know if I had mentioned it years ago, the people then\n",
      "at that time would have had… I don’t know. I just didn’t. This way I just thought\n",
      "was better, the way it happened.\n",
      "JZ: By just moving on?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, I just felt…\n",
      "JZ: So you went back to Westinghouse and met your wife?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, worked there, and got married. I got pension in ’82.\n",
      "JZ: I don’t remember if I asked you, but do you belong to the VFW?\n",
      "20\n",
      "CB: Oh yeah, I belong to the American Legion. I don’t belong to the VFW. And the\n",
      "DAV. That’s part of the American Legion.\n",
      "JZ: And what is that?\n",
      "CB: That’s…\n",
      "JZ: [People with] disabilities?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, that’s right, disability. It’s like an organization within an organization, but\n",
      "the American Legion.\n",
      "JZ: I hope you don’t mind me asking, do you get disability from the government?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, yeah, I get it yeah.\n",
      "JZ: From the veterans?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, I get disability.\n",
      "JZ: Tell me about your recent induction in the…\n",
      "CB: Yeah, over there, in the Hall of Valor.\n",
      "JZ: The Hall of Valor, and that’s here in Pittsburgh?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, that’s in Oakland, on Fifth Avenue in Oakland. It was 31 people that was,\n",
      "got the medal. There was somebody that was there, either brothers, sisters,\n",
      "nephews, uncle, you know, the ones that passed away, they represented the ones\n",
      "that were supposed to get the honor. And it was nice. They served us chicken,\n",
      "roast beef, potatoes, and a vegetable side dish. And then they had a salad, and a\n",
      "fruit bowl and coffee, cake. I mean it was really nice. That food, it was good.\n",
      "JZ: So how many people from your family were there?\n",
      "CB: I had 27 altogether. I had my sister-in-law, and I had my sister there. But the rest\n",
      "of them were nephews and nieces, from my other brother’s and sister’s families.\n",
      "JZ: Did you bring your medal? And they made this…\n",
      "21\n",
      "CB: This is identically the same thing, it’s a duplicate. One is staying down there, and\n",
      "this one belongs to me. Some of them had two or three of them they brought\n",
      "home.\n",
      "JZ: And you bought this one?\n",
      "CB: I just bought this, yeah.\n",
      "JZ: So this is down in the Soldiers and Sailor’s Memorial Hall?\n",
      "CB: Yeah. The one like that. There were 31 down there, identically the same one.\n",
      "Their thing is different, the reading is different. They had one person, we didn’t\n",
      "have to get up and say anything, but there was this one person, he read this\n",
      "citation, he had the citation. He read them all, and then they got up and stood\n",
      "besides him on one of this like a tripod, and took a picture. And then they, and\n",
      "then there was guys dressed in their army uniforms, big guys. They got them and\n",
      "put it on the tripod on the side of the wall in the hall we was at on both sides, on\n",
      "one side and then the other side. I guess afterwards they took them out and put\n",
      "them where they were going to be permanent. Yeah, I mean they had a nice\n",
      "program.\n",
      "JZ: When you came back, as an American did you feel it was your duty and you were\n",
      "proud?\n",
      "CB: Well, yeah, it was a thing that I was sent over there to do, and I thought I did it,\n",
      "and came back. I mean, I never get down on it. It was like another ordinary thing\n",
      "that I had to do.\n",
      "JZ: We don’t understand today, like, since you were an Italian, did you feel more\n",
      "American, or… you were American, you know, but, did your heritage play a part?\n",
      "CB: No, I never thought of it.\n",
      "JZ: Never thought of it?\n",
      "CB: Never thought of it.\n",
      "JZ: So you were an American. How did your dad feel and your mom?\n",
      "22\n",
      "CB: Well, I never asked them what they think. I guess they were proud. I guess they\n",
      "were proud that I went over there and I come back home.\n",
      "JZ: I guess because my generation, we think, “Oh, we’re Italian.”\n",
      "CB: No, because then you were running into all kinds of nationalities. And I guess\n",
      "they, we never talked about nationalities. I can’t remember. But if we did, we\n",
      "used to keep it to ourselves. It’s like I told you, that Italian sergeant became a\n",
      "field officer; he made it by doing his duty on the field. And here I guess we knew\n",
      "he was Italian, and he became a First Lieutenant by doing what he did on the\n",
      "field. It made us feel good. But we never mentioned it to anybody else about\n",
      "anything else about these Italians. In other words, there was lots of harmony with\n",
      "the soldiers; we were just close to one another. They, like I say, nationality or\n",
      "religion never…\n",
      "JZ: You say the Jewish fellow from Chicago gave you the money.\n",
      "CB: Yeah, gave me money to come home on. He said “I know you don’t have any\n",
      "money.” He said, “I’ll get you the money to go home.” So he gave me the money,\n",
      "come home, and when I come back, I gave it to him.\n",
      "JZ: Everybody just got along, everybody stuck together, and worked together, no?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, yeah. They, we helped one another out. I mean, whatever help was to be\n",
      "needed, we’d just help them out, you know?\n",
      "JZ: You think it had something to do, growing up during the Depression, and\n",
      "everybody being just…\n",
      "CB: Yeah, I mean, during the Depression, that didn’t get us down either because we\n",
      "were kids at the time. ’29, let’s see… 1919, I was ten years old in 1929. I guess\n",
      "my oldest brothers and sisters, they just, they felt it more because they were older.\n",
      "I guess you know what Depression was. Well, like everybody, even the people\n",
      "around us that lived in the neighborhood, they were in the same predicament we\n",
      "were at; the same shoes, everybody was poor. And everybody was the same.\n",
      "There was no one who showed that they had more than the next person.\n",
      "JZ: Same way we are in the service.\n",
      "CB: Yeah, I mean that’s right, we were the same. We were just like one big group.\n",
      "23\n",
      "JZ: A lot of the guys were from around different parts of the country too?\n",
      "CB: Right. They were New York, New Jersey, McKeesport, the fellows. A lot of time\n",
      "when they’d get a package when we was in the states before we went overseas,\n",
      "the package, they’d call us over, and we’d all share that package with them.\n",
      "Whatever the mother or the sisters or brothers put in there. That’s how it was.\n",
      "This one time this fellow’s brother came over to see him and he brought a big box\n",
      "of goodies. He brought fruit, he brought cookies, cakes, you name it, I mean, it\n",
      "was in a box. It didn’t last too long, (laughs)\n",
      "JZ: Did your mom send you anything?\n",
      "CB: Yeah, cookies, that’s what they did. But in the hospital that was one big room,\n",
      "people used to send boxes of cookies, whatever it was, they put it in the room. It\n",
      "wasn’t addressed to any particular person, it was just for the hospital, you know.\n",
      "So I guess that was the only thing they could do, the hospital just put it in the\n",
      "room, and I don’t know what they did after that. I mean surely they gave it to\n",
      "somebody. I guess if you went in there and asked for a box, one of them boxes,\n",
      "you’d go ahead and help yourself. The people were wonderful.\n",
      "JZ: Anything else you would like to say?\n",
      "CB: Well, I can’t think of anything else, I thought, do you have any other questions\n",
      "you want to ask me?\n",
      "JZ: You did a wonderful thing and served.\n",
      "CB: Thank you.\n",
      "JZ: And you made it… you should be very proud of yourself. So, again, thank you.\n",
      "CB: Thank you for having me.\n",

      "NC: Mr. Bruno, could you just start by telling me your date of birth and where you\n",
      "were born?\n",
      "JB: I was born February 8, 1925 up in Bloomfield on Cedarville Street.\n",
      "NC: So you’ve been a Pittsburgh resident most of your life?\n",
      "JB: Yeah except when I was in the army and a few trips I made. I was in Arizona last\n",
      "month as I told you. Born and raised in Bloomfield.\n",
      "NC: Bruno is an Italian name. Can you tell me about your Italian ancestry? Who was it\n",
      "that was in your family that came from Italy?\n",
      "JB: My mother and my father.\n",
      "NC: What were their names?\n",
      "JB: My father’s name was Bruno and my mother’s name was Orlendosi.\n",
      "NC: Was your father Joseph as well?\n",
      "JB: No, his father was Joseph. His name was Salvatore. That’s how Italians went,\n",
      "father, son, you named the son after grandfather. But my father’s name was\n",
      "Salvatore and my wife didn’t care for the name Salvatore but we never had a boy\n",
      "so there wasn’t a problem there. Because I was going to argue the point. We had\n",
      "all girls. You saw their picture.\n",
      "NC: So your mother and father were both born in Italy, do you know which part of\n",
      "Italy?\n",
      "JB: They were born in Agrigento, Sicily.\n",
      "1\n",
      "NC: When did they come over to the United States and why did they come over? Do\n",
      "you know those stories, did they ever tell you?\n",
      "JB: They came over because they thought living was better over here. They had\n",
      "relatives living and working over here and there’s a story there too. When they\n",
      "came over my father and his father were going to come over and go to work and\n",
      "save enough money to bring the rest of their family over. My mother’s father and\n",
      "mother were coming over too, but my father’s father had been dead. His mother\n",
      "didn’t want to come over with him until they had everything settled. Everything\n",
      "for the whole family to come over. No, wait a minute, his father wasn’t dead yet.\n",
      "He came over with his father with the intention of working and sending them over\n",
      "after they earned the money. He was here about six months, his father died in a\n",
      "mine cave in, outside of Greensburg in a little town named Luxor. Now he died\n",
      "and my father was here by himself with the people he came over with, my\n",
      "mother’s father and mother. My father told his mother in Italy that her husband\n",
      "was dead but he was going on with the plans of getting her over here. She didn’t\n",
      "want to come because her husband was dead so she wanted him to come back.\n",
      "Well, he didn’t want to come back. He was going to stay here. He was boarding,\n",
      "he was living with my mother’s parents in their house in Luxor. Well, my mother\n",
      "and father were together and ended up marrying each other. Then they moved to\n",
      "Pittsburgh. I told you he was in the mafia and was making his money by making\n",
      "moonshine.\n",
      "NC: Was that in Pittsburgh or when he was in Luxor?\n",
      "JB: No, when he was in Luxor. Then they came to Pittsburgh because there were\n",
      "more customers here. And the mafia wanted him here in Pittsburgh because he\n",
      "was a big man in the mafia at the time. So he came over to Pittsburgh with his\n",
      "wife and that’s when I was born. And I had brothers and sisters after that.\n",
      "NC: So your father started off working in the coal mines. Did he ever tell stories about\n",
      "the work in the coal mines, what it was like, what the conditions were like?\n",
      "JB: No, all we know is that you went in when the sun was down and you came out.\n",
      "You never saw the sun. You came out when the sun was down. You went in early\n",
      "in the morning and the sun came up. You’re in the mine all that time. Then the\n",
      "sun would come up when you were in the mine. You come up at night and the sun\n",
      "would be down. He would say you would go a week without seeing the sun.\n",
      "That’s what he told me. Then like I said, he was making more money delivering\n",
      "2\n",
      "moonshine. Then my grandfather, who he lived with at the time, was the cooker.\n",
      "They called him the cooker because he would make the whisky. He knew the\n",
      "ingredients to put in. People used to come from as far as Cleveland and New York\n",
      "to get him to make the still for them and show them how to make the moonshine.\n",
      "He was pretty well known. He lived to be ninety-eight years old.\n",
      "NC: That was your dad’s father?\n",
      "JB: No, my mother’s father. My dad’s father died in the mine.\n",
      "NC: So your grandfather on your mother’s side was involved with making stills and\n",
      "that was during the prohibition period, I’m assuming, when it was illegal to make\n",
      "alcohol. And your father then got involved in the business and eventually moved\n",
      "to Pittsburgh. Do you think one of the reasons he got into that business was that\n",
      "he wanted to get out of mines?\n",
      "JB: Well, it could have been. One of the funny things that happened, on Sundays,\n",
      "when we were home from school, he would be down in the cellar with my\n",
      "grandfather and two or three other guys doing things we didn’t know about. They\n",
      "would always be filling these bottles and cases and putting them on the side.\n",
      "These cases would reach up to the ceiling, they didn’t have high ceilings. We\n",
      "asked my mother, “What are they doing?” She told us they were making root\n",
      "beer. Oh okay, good. What was funny when we wanted root beer, we had to go to\n",
      "the store to buy it. When we came home from school on Monday, now this was\n",
      "Sunday they were working, all the root beer was gone. We were kids we didn’t\n",
      "know, but all I remember was when we needed root beer we went to the store and\n",
      "they were making root beer and we couldn’t drink it.\n",
      "NC: Was this in your basement?\n",
      "JB: Yeah.\n",
      "NC: Where you living on Cedarville at that time?\n",
      "JB: No, we were living on Paulson Avenue, right outside of East Liberty. Do you\n",
      "know where that’s at?\n",
      "NC: I do.\n",
      "3\n",
      "JB: Paulson Avenue is where we lived. I remember that, it was 1932. I remember the\n",
      "year, you know why? There was an old car sitting on the street with a license\n",
      "plate, it was 1930 and this was 1932 and they couldn’t drive it. It just sat there for\n",
      "months. That’s why I remember the year.\n",
      "NC: Were the people that were involved with making the moonshine, were they\n",
      "mainly your dad’s friends, like other Italian Americans?\n",
      "JB: Oh yeah most of them were from the same village in Sicily.\n",
      "NC: What would they do once they made it?\n",
      "JB: They sold it. Night clubs used to be their biggest customers. But they had\n",
      "people… I can tell you another incident. We had a store in Bloomfield on Liberty\n",
      "Avenue, a grocery store that we sold liquor over the counter. Of course we didn’t,\n",
      "when my father was there and someone.., they would take them into the back and\n",
      "put it in a bag. Soon, one day this policeman walking the beat comes in. He says,\n",
      "“Hey Jack, can I see you a minute?” He says, “I know your selling moonshine”.\n",
      "He said “I just wanted to tell you if you give me something I’ll forget about it.\n",
      "Give me five dollars a week and I won’t say nothing.” My father told him, “Okay,\n",
      "let me think it over,” He gave him the five for that first week. So about a week\n",
      "later he comes in and says, “Hey, Jack, oh my God, why you didn’t tell me you\n",
      "were giving money to the lieutenant.” My father told the lieutenant, about having\n",
      "to pay this other guy. “They shipped me out to Highland Park.” It was like the\n",
      "boondocks. Now I’m not working in Bloomfield. I’m working out there. Tell\n",
      "them I don’t want the money no more. So my father told them and he came back\n",
      "on his Bloomfield beat. My father said,” I had to pay him too.” The lieutenant\n",
      "said, “No you pay me.”\n",
      "NC: So was that your dad’s only job?\n",
      "JB: Well he was a salesman. Because when we went to school they wanted father’s\n",
      "name and occupation. He used to sell olive oil and cheese. I don’t know how\n",
      "much he sold of it but that’s what we reported. We had two restaurants in\n",
      "Bloomfield, grocery store and a pool room, all in Bloomfield.\n",
      "NC: This is when you were growing up? This was in twenties and thirties and that\n",
      "period of time.\n",
      "4\n",
      "JB: Yeah, in the thirties and forties. I was born in 1925 and went to grade school at\n",
      "Immaculate Conception until I went to high school. I went to Schenley High\n",
      "School.\n",
      "NC: Did your dad have connections with other figures in Pittsburgh?\n",
      "JB: Well, yes he did.\n",
      "NC: He seemed to have made a pretty good living for the family.\n",
      "JB: Oh yeah, we never needed anything. I’ll tell you another instance that happened. I\n",
      "went to school and this lady come around one time. They wanted us kids to go\n",
      "around selling magazines, door to door selling magazines and we’d make money.\n",
      "So I came home and told my father, “Look I’m going to sell magazines.” He\n",
      "grabbed them and said,”You ain’t selling nothing.”, “You’re going to school to\n",
      "get an education.” He tore up the things up I had to use …. He said “You don’t\n",
      "worry about it. I’ll take care of the money coming into the house. You’re going\n",
      "to school and get an education.” and that was it. One time, it was Christmas time.\n",
      "I was in High School and Christmas vacation they needed workers at the post\n",
      "office. I told my dad that I could go to work, and I told him it wasn’t hard work,\n",
      "all I would do is deliver mail or sort it. I think they still do that because they\n",
      "would get a weeks vacation and the mail was heavy. He said okay to that. I\n",
      "worked in the Post Office during Christmas Vacation.\n",
      "NC: What do you recall about the Italian community in both East Liberty and\n",
      "Bloomfield? Was it a pretty close community?\n",
      "JB: They were close. When I got married she wasn’t Italian, she was Irish. My\n",
      "grandfather was strictly against it and wanted to send me to Sicily to get a girl. I\n",
      "said no, I got a girl. We had a little bit of discussion not an argument. Well one\n",
      "night I took him up to the Pleasure Bar. Do you know remember the Pleasure\n",
      "Bar? “See those girls sitting at the bar. Chi sei una puttana.” Do you know what a\n",
      "puttana is? Whore. I told him,” See that one over there, she’s Italian, and she’s a\n",
      "whore too.” I’m talking Italian now. See that one over there? Do you think she’s\n",
      "Italian? “Oh I don’t know” he says. Well she’s Italian and she’s a whore too.\n",
      "There were three of them there, and I asked, “Now do you want me to marry one\n",
      "of them?” Well, that did it. So finally we got married and we had two kids.\n",
      "Everybody came over except my grandfather. We lived, you know where Yew\n",
      "Street is? We lived on Taylor Street and they lived on Yew Street. That’s\n",
      "something else about Italians. Their parents never went into an old age home, they\n",
      "5\n",
      "lived with their kids. Anyway, my grandfather and grandmother were living with\n",
      "my parents. They’re only a block away from our house. One day I came back\n",
      "from work, I had a good job then. I came home from work and my wife goes,\n",
      "“You’ll never guess who was here. Your grandfather was here.” After two years\n",
      "we lived there. “Your grandfather was here and gave the kids each a dime,” she\n",
      "said. Well that broke the barrier and we were alright after that.\n",
      "NC: The reason why he didn’t come for so many years was because she was Irish?\n",
      "JB: Right, she wasn’t Italian.\n",
      "NC: Sounds like there was a lot of animosity between the Irish and Italian community.\n",
      "JB: Well I don’t know if it was the community. I think it was just my grandfather, that\n",
      "he was hardheaded. …He was ninety-eight when he passed away. He had all his\n",
      "teeth. …He didn’t drink water for thirty years. All he drank was wine, he made\n",
      "wine every year…. Everyone had his wine……\n",
      "NC: Where did he make it, in the basement?\n",
      "JB: In the cellar.\n",
      "NC: Were you ever involved in the process?\n",
      "JB: Yeah we helped. Have you ever seen how you make wine, they have the thing\n",
      "you turn and squeeze it and it would come down. Sometimes it drips for hours….\n",
      "Did you ever see in a backyard when they have those big piles of grapes, that’s\n",
      "what it is. They would dump it out into the yard. The rubbish men take it away.\n",
      "You give the rubbish men a dollar & they take it away. Not a dollar. A bottle of\n",
      "wine. Oh yeah. They’re waiting for it.\n",
      "NC: Now would kids drink wine a little bit when you were growing up?\n",
      "JB: Well, no, a little bit but not too much. I don’t think they wanted us to drink it. See\n",
      "what happened one time, my grandfather is sitting on the couch watching\n",
      "television and starts coughing. My sister runs and gets him a glass of water and\n",
      "brings in it over to him. He spits it out and asks, “What the hell was that?” My\n",
      "sister said, “Well that was water.” He says to my grandmother, “Get me a drink,”\n",
      "and she gets him a glass of wine.\n",
      "6\n",
      "NC: Did your family, who came from Sicily, did they primarily have friendships with\n",
      "other people from Sicily? What were the relationships like between Italians from\n",
      "Sicily verses those from other regions?\n",
      "JB: Well it was a little closer. Now, they didn’t ignore them, they were friendly with\n",
      "them but the Sicilians were pretty close. Well they claim that’s where the mafia\n",
      "was born and I think my grandfather was the one who started it. Oh God, he was\n",
      "something else.\n",
      "NC: I’m sure he had some stories.\n",
      "JB: They wanted me to go to Sicily when I was going overseas because they still had\n",
      "family over there but I never got a chance. I saw it when I was in Southern France\n",
      "in the Rivera. I saw it across the bay. I could see it but I never got to go there.\n",
      "NC: Did your father ever make any trips back to Italy?\n",
      "JB: Oh yeah. I got a picture.\n",
      "NC: So you were born in Bloomfield in 1925. What are some of your earliest\n",
      "memories growing up in Bloomfield? Is there anything that stands out about the\n",
      "community that you lived in or your family life? Was it a distinctively Italian\n",
      "home, what aspects of the Italian culture were common?\n",
      "JB: We had to speak Italian because my grandmother and grandfather lived with us. I\n",
      "can’t think of anything else.\n",
      "NC: Did your mom cook Italian food?\n",
      "JB: Oh yeah every Saturday and Sunday we would have big meals.\n",
      "NC: Was it a big extended family? For instance did you have any brothers and sisters?\n",
      "JB: I had two brothers and two sisters. I was the oldest. My one brother and sister\n",
      "passed away. I got a brother and a sister still alive.\n",
      "NC: So it was a decent sized family. Tell me about you going to school. You\n",
      "mentioned earlier that your dad was really adamant about you getting an\n",
      "education opposed to going out into the work force. What schools did you go to?\n",
      "Did you go to Catholic schools?\n",
      "7\n",
      "JB: I went to Immaculate Conception in Bloomfield and then I went to Baxter Junior\n",
      "High School in Brushton. Then we moved back to Bloomfield and went to\n",
      "Schenley High School. I graduated from Schenley High School. See I had to go to\n",
      "the Army; I turned eighteen when I was senior in high school. The draft board\n",
      "gave me time to finish school and then I would have to go to the Army. Well, I\n",
      "never got my diploma but then a couple years ago they had this situation for those\n",
      "ones that didn’t. But I got my diploma. See it up there. Then I went to Duquesne.\n",
      "I was a football player. I got those here…..\n",
      "NC: Is that after the Army?\n",
      "JB: After the army. You know, they never played football in Europe. We won the first\n",
      "football championship that was ever played in Europe. Now they play, they have\n",
      "regular leagues of football. ….(Looking at pictures…..)\n",
      "NC: So you were in high school around the time when World War II broke out, at the\n",
      "time of Pearl Harbor. Do you remember specifically where you were, what you\n",
      "were doing when the announcement came?\n",
      "JB: I remember, I heard it on the radio. I was coming out of the show, it was a\n",
      "Sunday. We stopped at this drug store and it was on the radio and everyone was\n",
      "listening. I didn’t know what they were talking about. But I remember that.\n",
      "Sunday we came home. The next day I went to school, to Schenley High School,\n",
      "everybody had to go into the auditorium and they had President Roosevelt’s\n",
      "speech on the radio. They had all the kids listening to the president’s speech. We\n",
      "went back to our room and the teacher said, “I know you kids don’t understand\n",
      "but we’re all, everybody in this room, is going to be involved with this war in\n",
      "some way or another.” We figured what did she know? She was right. She was\n",
      "crying.\n",
      "NC: At that time did you realize that you would have to go and fight this war?\n",
      "JB: No, no I didn’t. That must have been 1941.\n",
      "NC: And when did you graduate from high school?\n",
      "JB: 1943. I wasn’t eighteen yet. You had to be eighteen or more to be drafted. Well I\n",
      "was eighteen on February the eighth 1943; I went down to sign up but they told\n",
      "me they would give me time to graduate which was in June. Well I’ll tell you\n",
      "8\n",
      "what happened, our graduation exercise was at nine o’clock…….. Oh God. I can’t\n",
      "remember. Any how I had to report to the train station forty-five minutes after\n",
      "graduation started. I had to go over to P&LE to get to camp.\n",
      "NC: What is P&LE?\n",
      "JB: Pennsylvania and Lake Erie. Over on Southside.\n",
      "NC: Where were you going to?\n",
      "JB: I went to Fort Dix, New Jersey.\n",
      "NC: After Pearl Harbor happened and the United States went to war, were you\n",
      "exposed to any sort of anti-Italian sentiment because we were at war with Italy?\n",
      "Did that affect you in high school?\n",
      "JB: No. I had a personal experience when a guy called me Little Mussolini. I knocked\n",
      "him on his ass. …. I was little but I was mean. I was picked up for murder one\n",
      "time. This guy owed me money in Bloomfield… Everyone owned money, I owed\n",
      "money. I heard one day that he hit the numbers. I went up to this bar he worked\n",
      "at, right on Liberty Avenue, his name was Rudy Pacozzi. He was a bartender. I\n",
      "go, “Rudy, what are you going to do about that money you owe me?” He asked\n",
      "me what I was going to do about it. It set me off again; they had to pull me off of\n",
      "the guy. Now a week later, maybe two, I’m walking down the street and these two\n",
      "guys come up to me.”Joe Bruno?” Yeah. “Where were you on this particular\n",
      "night? I told them I was at home. “You weren’t down at the Ateletta Club?”\n",
      "That’s where it happened. “You heard about Rudy”. I said “Yeah, I heard about\n",
      "him. He killed himself in the club. “Well that’s what everybody thinks but you I\n",
      "had a disagreement with him.” Well... “He never paid you the money he owed\n",
      "you. What are you going to do about it?” Well what can I do now? “Yeah, what\n",
      "can you do now?” Then they asked me if I was related to Big Jack and told me I\n",
      "was in big trouble. Well I got evidence of where I was at. He actually did shoot\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "NC: At the club?\n",
      "JB: Yeah, he owed big bookies from New Kensington about five thousand dollars I\n",
      "think. They told him if he didn’t have it by Monday they were going to come see\n",
      "him. Well this was on Sunday night he went down the basement at the club and\n",
      "shot himself. Rudy Pacozzi. You can check on it.\n",
      "9\n",

      "JB: Yeah it had to be.\n",
      "NC: So when you were in high school, did this guy call you Little Mussolini?\n",
      "JB: No, that was in the Army I think.\n",
      "NC: What was your reaction to that?\n",
      "JB: I didn’t like it. I let him know about it. Like I said, I wasn’t a big guy, I wasn’t a\n",
      "mean guy either but I didn’t take no shit from nobody\n",
      "NC: Tell me about how you came to be in Army? By the time you were eighteen you\n",
      "had to register for the draft and then you were drafted?\n",
      "JB: Yeah. They gave me time to graduate from school, which I did.\n",
      "NC: What branch were you in, the Army?\n",
      "JB: I was in the Army. You had two choices. If you went to the Army you had two\n",
      "weeks before you went. If you went to the Navy you had one week. Because I had\n",
      "the two weeks I took the Army. That’s how it ended up.\n",
      "NC: How did your parents feel when you told them that you had been drafted?\n",
      "JB: Well, what could they say? They didn’t like it but they knew it wasn’t anything I\n",
      "did wrong. Oh, gee. I have to get my cigarettes.\n",
      "NC: Were they proud of you?\n",
      "JB: Oh yeah. They came down to see me off at the train. It was the first time I ever\n",
      "saw him cry. My father never cried. They put me in the Medical Corps.\n",
      "NC: Did you find out right away that you would be in the Medical Corps or was that\n",
      "after?\n",
      "JB: No, at the boot camp.\n",
      "10\n",
      "NC: Tell me about where you went when you first got onto the train.\n",
      "JB: We went to Fort Dix, New Jersey where they called it boot camp. You go through\n",
      "just getting ready for wherever you’re going. I forget how much time it was …\n",
      "about a month or two and they assign you to a different organization. I was in the\n",
      "409th Ambulance Company and I didn’t know how to drive. I never drove.\n",
      "NC: So boot camp was mainly a physical activity, running and exercising and that sort\n",
      "of thing? How about firearms training?\n",
      "JB: No, we had no firearms training. Then I didn’t like that so I asked if I could be\n",
      "transferred to tank corp. The only thing that was open was the infantry and I took\n",
      "it.\n",
      "NC: Why didn’t you like the Ambulance Corps?\n",
      "JB: I wanted action. They would teach you how to carry a stretcher and how to give\n",
      "shots. They gave you an orange…. I didn’t go into the army for that, I wanted\n",
      "action. I volunteered and they sent me to the 63rd Infantry Division.\n",
      "NC: After boot camp were you assigned to the 409th Ambulance in Fort Dix? Did you\n",
      "move on to something else?\n",
      "JB: I think they just transferred me to a different camp.\n",
      "NC: It was 1943 when you first went into the Army?\n",
      "JB: Right.\n",
      "NC: Did you know a lot of the men you trained with at boot camp or were they all\n",
      "from all over the country?\n",
      "JB: No, they were all from Pittsburgh but I don’t think I knew anyone. I just knew\n",
      "people from my neighborhood and they weren’t from there.\n",
      "NC: Where a lot of them from Italian descent?\n",
      "JB: No, all different kinds.\n",
      "NC: Were you nervous when you were leaving Pittsburgh for the army?\n",
      "11\n",
      "JB: I was a little sad. I had never been away from home. I was a little sad on the train.\n",
      "In fact no one slept that night. Everyone was awake all night long.\n",
      "NC: Once you joined up with the 63rd Infantry Division, is that when you started\n",
      "getting training in weaponry?\n",
      "JB: Right, then one day I saw a bulletin board posting, they needed volunteers for\n",
      "soldiers to be a paratrooper. Well I had a cousin that was in the 101st and he came\n",
      "home on furlough while I was still a civilian. He was telling me how great it was,\n",
      "jumping out of airplanes. When they put that sign up for volunteers for the\n",
      "paratroopers, I signed up right away.\n",
      "NC: Had you ever been in a plane in your life at the point when you signed up?\n",
      "JB: No, never. So now I went down to Fort Benning, and four weeks later you get\n",
      "your wings and I was on a plane.\n",
      "NC: Is Fort Benning in Georgia?\n",
      "JB: Yeah.\n",
      "NC: Tell me a little bit about the training for paratrooper. That was kind of like\n",
      "rigorous regimen.\n",
      "JB: We had guys that couldn’t make it. We had a lieutenant colonel, he wanted to be a\n",
      "paratrooper and go through the same training. He went through what they call\n",
      "stage A, B, C, and D. Four weeks. The first week is all physical. He went through\n",
      "it three times before he could pass the physical and then B,C and D is the fourth\n",
      "week that you jump.\n",
      "NC: What kind of physical activities would you have to do?\n",
      "JB: Climb a rope, climb over walls with no help. Do it yourself I forgot, there were\n",
      "different ways you could do it but it was strenuous. You went through a tunnel, it\n",
      "was strenuous. It was no thinking at all, just had to have a good body. I was\n",
      "eighteen-nineteen years old.\n",
      "NC: And what was the second week?\n",
      "12\n",
      "JB: Second week was the same thing but less strenuous. The third week was packing\n",
      "your chute. The fourth week was jumping. That was the first time I smoked a\n",
      "cigarette.\n",
      "NC: When?\n",
      "JB: When you’re jumping and have your chute on and you’re not supposed to have\n",
      "anything in your pockets because of the straps. So now we’re in what they called\n",
      "the sweat shed, in this building waiting to go onto the plane. This guy comes\n",
      "down handing out cigarettes to the guys, so he came to me and I told him I didn’t\n",
      "smoke so he passed me up. He gave everyone a cigarette to smoke while they\n",
      "were waiting. The third day I’m there this guy said, “Take it and give it to me.”\n",
      "So I took it and when they left, that guy smoked two. The next day, I see everyone\n",
      "smoking and I thought I would give it a try. The guy came around handed out\n",
      "cigarettes, I took it and I lit it. That was a hell of an experience.\n",
      "NC: Was that before your first jump?\n",
      "JB: Yeah. The next week was five jumps, Monday through Thursday day jumps and\n",
      "Friday was a night jump. Then Saturday we had a big parade and celebration and\n",
      "we got our wings.\n",
      "NC: How nervous were you on your first jump?\n",
      "JB: Well, a little bit nervous. Guys tell you after your first jump, you become used to\n",
      "it. They’re full of shit. You’re nervous every time you jump because you don’t\n",
      "know what could go wrong. But then in combat… I’ll tell you a thing that did\n",
      "happen to me, when you go out of a plane you only have some much time to jump\n",
      "in one area…. Did you ever see they go one after another? Because if you miss\n",
      "your drop zone, you’ll hit trees or water. One time I hit a barn during my night\n",
      "jump.\n",
      "NC: You hit a barn?\n",
      "JB: Yeah. I didn’t get hurt.\n",
      "NC: What did you hit, the roof of it?\n",
      "JB: No. On the side. I didn’t think I would be hitting anything. What happened the\n",
      "one time….I went out … ….the first thing you’re supposed to do, you go out and\n",
      "13\n",
      "you’re …your chute opens…check & see…When you are jumping in training...\n",
      "you have an emergency chute, you’re supposed to have that in case your chute\n",
      "doesn’t open you use this in training. You’re supposed to look up. So I look up\n",
      "and my chute was open so I am okay. All of a sudden, I’m looking down and I\n",
      "feel the straps are going limp. I look up, the chute... It’s like a handkerchief. Here\n",
      "I landed on another guys chute and his chute was taking the air and mine wasn’t.\n",
      "Mine started to fold. I started running; they tell you run just like its cement. I\n",
      "went off, I went down again……It finally opened.\n",
      "NC: You were running on top of it?\n",
      "JB: Yeah. And I’m telling you it felt like you’re on the sidewalk. I was running,\n",
      "finally I was off, I went down a little bit, then it... my chute…. See the air comes\n",
      "up and that’s what hold the chute up and if you’re on top of another chute he’s\n",
      "getting all the air and you’re not. I looked up-..Oh my God. It’s all white. I\n",
      "started running.\n",
      "NC: When you were in jump school, were there any accidents that were people injured\n",
      "and killed?\n",
      "JB: Yeah. I don’t know what happened, this one guy’s chute didn’t open. So he\n",
      "opened his emergency chute. Now here’s what happens. Your main chute is here\n",
      "and your emergency chute is here. You’re going down really fast. He fell and\n",
      "broke his legs. They teach you how to land; …if your legs are stiff.. You gotta\n",
      "be… he must have had stiff like. Because he broke his leg. That’s the only thing I\n",
      "experienced.\n",
      "NC: When you do the practice jumps do you have all the gear with you as well or just\n",
      "the chute?\n",
      "JB: Just the two chutes. In combat you don’t have an emergency chute, if you don’t\n",
      "land…. They drop you at twelve hundred feet……. It’s so nice the feeling, you’re\n",
      "coming down and you don’t hear a thing until you get down close to the ground,\n",
      "you hear cars & people.... You don’t realize it. Up there it is quiet as hell. The\n",
      "sound of the street.\n",
      "NC: It sounds from your description that you were pretty comfortable doing this.\n",
      "JB: Yeah, it was fun. Once it opened, you were alright. Like I said, you don’t feel like\n",
      "it’s easy now. You still have a little anxiety. What are you going to do?\n",
      "14\n",
      "NC: When you were going through the training, both the boot camp and the jump\n",
      "school, was any part of the training propaganda? Anti-German propaganda? More\n",
      "physical training….\n",
      "JB: In fact, the only thing they taught us was how to kill. Kill a guy with your hands,\n",
      "where to hit him, how to hit him. They never said anything about the Germans,\n",
      "Italians or Japanese. They assumed we knew what the hell we were doing.\n",
      "NC: So jump school was four weeks total?\n",
      "JB: Four weeks, yeah.\n",
      "NC: And after that you do your final night jump then you get your wings?\n",
      "JB: Yeah, the next day you get your wings.\n",
      "NC: And then you are assigned to a unit?\n",
      "JB: Right.\n",
      "NC: What was your unit?\n",
      "JB: 82nd.\n",
      "NC: What did that mean? That meant you got to leave Fort Benning, Georgia? And go\n",
      "to another camp?\n",
      "JB: Right.\n",
      "NC: Where do you go after Fort Benning? Do you remember? Eventually you went\n",
      "overseas.\n",
      "JB: Right. I went overseas…We went on maneuvers in Louisiana. No that was with\n",
      "the 63rd. Then I came back after boot camp... ..I think I went to Fort Dix…We\n",
      "were expecting to go to another camp instead we went overseas. We replaced the\n",
      "outfit we were assigned to in England, South Hampton.\n",
      "NC: Did many of the guys that went to jump school with you go with you to the 82nd?\n",
      "15\n",
      "JB: Oh yeah.\n",
      "NC: So by then you developed some friendships with some of the other soldiers.\n",
      "JB: Oh yeah.\n",
      "NC: When would you have been overseas? If you first went into the service in 1943,\n",
      "was it late it 1943 or early in 1944?\n",
      "JB: No, it was early 1944. I think it was February.\n",
      "NC: I guess you pretty much knew at some point you would have to go overseas.\n",
      "JB: Oh yeah. We were concerned. We didn’t want to fight the Japanese. I mean, that’s\n",
      "how I felt. ……They were fighting on islands and I didn’t like water. That’s the\n",
      "only thing I was thinking about. Fighting the Japanese and going over there.\n",
      "NC: So for you it was a kind of relief when you found out you were going to Europe?\n",
      "JB: Yeah.\n",
      "NC: Tell me about the 82nd Airborne. Was that a pretty well known unit at the time?\n",
      "JB: No, it wasn’t too well known. None of them got well known until after things\n",
      "happened… Well, the one 102nd got a lot of publicity with Bastogne. The\n",
      "82nd..We never had that much, we just did what we had to do. A couple things\n",
      "happened to you but you don’t like talking about them. I don’t want to say\n",
      "nothing. I can’t. I don’t feel right about it.\n",
      "NC: So you went overseas and went to South Hampton? What part of England is that?\n",
      "JB: It’s right across the bay from France, across the English Channel. That’s where\n",
      "we’re going to go. I’ll show you the letter.\n",
      "NC: How did you get over to Europe?\n",
      "JB: On the ship. It was a French ship with an English crew and American soldiers. It\n",
      "was called Ile de France. It was a big luxury liner. It wasn’t that luxury. We had\n",
      "five cots downstairs. First time… I didn’t know there were elevators on ships.\n",
      "We were marching in, walking from one building to another, then we see elevator.\n",
      "16\n",
      "Next thing you know we’re going down the steps. The elevator’s in the ship.\n",
      "We’re on the ship already. Didn’t know that.\n",
      "NC: What was the mood of the unit and your fellow soldiers?\n",
      "JB: We were playing cards, having a good time. We made sure your equipment was\n",
      "A-1 , That was the main thing that you are concerned with.—your equipment.\n",
      "NC: Tell me about what kind of equipment you had, just the standards.\n",
      "JB: The standard was an M-1 rifle. Bayonet. We were taught how to use grenades in\n",
      "the states. …They were with us but we didn’t carry them on us. The main thing\n",
      "was a knife. Only paratroopers had them in case you got stuck in the tree and had\n",
      "to cut yourself loose. We had these special made boots to hold the long knife. I\n",
      "should have brought one home. I brought a sword home I took off a German\n",
      "officer. And I had a ring I took off a German officer. I had to shoot his finger off\n",
      "to get it. It was a swastika ring. SS Troopers….. You know what happened?\n",
      "Coming home on the train waiting in Grand Central Station waiting for the train\n",
      "back to Pittsburgh I took the ring off to wash my hands “Hey Bruno our train is\n",
      "leaving!”, and I run out and left the ring there.\n",
      "[End Tape 1, Side A]\n",
      "[Begin Tape 1, Side B]\n",
      "NC: The sword was the sword of an army officer. And the ring was off of a soldier.\n",
      "..An SS officer.\n",
      "JB: An SS officer. Oh, they were surrendering left & right at the end.\n",
      "NC: What happened when you first got over to England? What was your unit assigned\n",
      "to do?\n",
      "JB: Nothing…We were just waiting to go on the ship. We thought we were going\n",
      "over on the ship to go over to France. We didn’t know we were going to jump.\n",
      "NC: Were you involved in D-Day?\n",
      "17\n",
      "JB: Yeah, that’s what I’m saying. The week before that, we weren’t allowed to write\n",
      "or tell anybody where were at or what we were doing. All our mail was checked\n",
      "over and everything... The night before we were told, “Be ready. We’re going to\n",
      "leave.” We didn’t know…We thought we were leaving at regular time by train\n",
      "or ship. We ended up on the planes at two o’clock in the morning. That’s how the\n",
      "book came about, The Longest Day.\n",
      "NC: So you didn’t have much notice whatsoever.\n",
      "JB: No, no notice at all. They don’t tell you nothing.\n",
      "NC: What was the role of the 82nd Airborne on D-Day? What were their objectives?\n",
      "JB: We had to take this town called Sainte-Mère-Église and hold it until the land\n",
      "forces came. When we landed, when we got there, it was rough getting in there. A\n",
      "lot of guys were jumping, or getting lost. There was a little confusion. You’re in\n",
      "enemy territory. It wasn’t enemy country. But the soldiers are all enemy. You\n",
      "were leery of everything. Finally we got our group together. We went in .We\n",
      "took over the town…. I forgot... I think it was the 29th . I forgot the first division\n",
      "that came in.\n",
      "NC: On this D-Day operation, this would have been your first combat? What were you\n",
      "feeling then? Were you scared?....\n",
      "JB: It’s hard…. You have to think, “Could I really kill someone?” But then you got to\n",
      "remember what they tell you, if you don’t kill them, they’ll kill you. That’s the\n",
      "main thing. What the hell, I was only nineteen years old. (sighs)\n",
      "NC: The jump happened at two in the morning. What kind of plane did you fly?\n",
      "JB: A C-47.\n",
      "NC: And about how many people would jump out of one C-47?\n",
      "JB: Well, twenty-four. Two sticks. Twelve and twelve. That’s why you have to go\n",
      "out right away. …The landing zone… The French underground gave them a lot\n",
      "of information and they knew just where to drop you and everything. You had to\n",
      "get out of that plane real fast.\n",
      "18\n",
      "NC: So when you’re on the plane flying, you have all your equipment together. It’s all\n",
      "packed away? What about your rifle? It’s slung over your shoulder?\n",
      "JB: Oh yeah. Rifles, got a .45 too and a knife and bayonet. Oh God, yes. They made\n",
      "sure you had enough weapons.\n",
      "NC: And what is the person that signals you to jump out of the plane?\n",
      "JB: He’s the jump master.\n",
      "NC: He would signal you and say go…?\n",
      "JB: There was a light right above the door. You can’t be tall, how tall are you?\n",
      "…They might not let you in. You can’t be too tall to be a paratrooper because of\n",
      "the doors of the plane. This one guy, , that I knew from before was six foot two\n",
      "and he couldn’t get in. He wanted to volunteer for it but he couldn’t get in. He\n",
      "was too tall. This is the door…As soon as the light goes on the jump master is\n",
      "there. You’re waiting to stand up and hook up. Ever hear that expression? Stand\n",
      "up Hook up. Put up the static line then the cord would automatically open your\n",
      "chute up and then just guide yourself in.\n",
      "NC: Could you see anything when you jumped that night?\n",
      "JB: No, no, it was really dark. You couldn’t see nothing. The only thing…. I can’t\n",
      "remember if you could see the water. I don’t know if you could see water or not.\n",
      "We weren’t near any water.\n",
      "NC: You had a successful jump? You landed in the field?\n",
      "JB: Yeah I landed in the field. …….The stick I was with landed together. Practically\n",
      "all of us landed together in an area.\n",
      "NC: What’s the first thing did once you hit the ground?\n",
      "JB: Well, we got together with the other guys to make sure we were in enemy\n",
      "territory and we went up to this town. We got our lieutenant. Everybody was there\n",
      "NC: Do you stow your chute right away?\n",
      "19\n",
      "JB: No, you left it. To get it loose, you just have to press this one button and the straps\n",
      "come off unless…. And that’s why you have the knife, in case you have to cut\n",
      "them loose.\n",
      "NC: Did you find one of your fellow soldiers right away? Did you have to look\n",
      "around for him?\n",
      "JB: Yeah, we found each other right away.\n",
      "NC: Was there some sort of signaling code that you could use?\n",
      "JB: Oh, yeah the cricket. Did you ever hear about the cricket?\n",
      "NC: Was it a device?\n",
      "JB: Yeah, it was a toy, a device used to let someone know who you are…...\n",
      "NC: And you would click it how many times? Just once?\n",
      "JB: Just once.\n",
      "NC: And then the person near you would click it as well?\n",
      "JB: Then you would know we were the same.\n",
      "NC: Did you have your rifle out at the time?\n",
      "JB: Oh, yeah. As soon as you land.\n",
      "NC: You went to Sainte-Mère-Église?\n",
      "JB: Yeah. That’s where we landed.\n",
      "NC: And that was the objective, to secure the town? Was there any resistance in the\n",
      "town?\n",
      "JB: No. A little bit but hardly any. It was a French town, don’t forget. It wasn’t\n",
      "German. In the morning they found out we were there and we had a few\n",
      "encounters then.\n",
      "20\n",
      "NC: So the Germans sent troops in?\n",
      "JB: Oh yeah.\n",

      "JB: I was in the ditch right outside of town with a couple other guys.\n",
      "NC: What were your orders?\n",
      "JB: Well, we were to go in as far as we could until reinforcements caught up with us.\n",
      "We went in. We were there for maybe seven or eight hours. We got\n",
      "reinforcements and we went back. It’s hard to remember everything we did.\n",
      "NC: Was there action against the Germans?\n",
      "JB: Oh yeah. Don’t ask me. They were killing us. I don’t know….\n",
      "NC: So the objective was to really just a secure some of the town?\n",
      "JB: Hold the town until the landing boats came in and took over and then we would\n",
      "be relieved. They really meant to be relieved. I never thought I would live to see\n",
      "the day.\n",

      "it. I walked out of the train. People were getting into cabs, others walking down\n",
      "the streets of Pittsburgh. So there was a cab, so I jumped in and gave the driver\n",
      "my address. There were sixteen miles to the outside of Butler. So he said “Wait a\n",
      "minute!” He got out of the cab, and he took my only identification I had.\n",
      "1\n",
      "JZ: What was your identification?\n",
      "AC: Name and address, and the location to my dad’s. So he went in to the station, and\n",
      "he wasn’t coming back. So I said, “What the hell is going on?” So I got my\n",
      "suitcase, and I went in; he was talking to this guy sweeping the floor. So he saw\n",
      "me, and he called me over. And he said, “You’re going to wait until seven o’clock\n",
      "in the morning, and it will cost thirteen dollars.”\n",
      "JZ: Did you speak with this guy in Italian?\n",
      "AC: Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "JZ: Did you understand him in Italian?\n",
      "AC: Yeah. I went to school over there, and I was sixteen years old. I said no because I\n",
      "didn’t have enough money on me. My dad just sent me enough for the trip. And\n",
      "my dad was going from the station, to Pennsylvania Station, looking for me. He\n",
      "knew I was coming in. So I grabbed my little suitcase and I went over by the\n",
      "bench, put the suitcase down, and I lay down. I was going to go to sleep. As soon\n",
      "I laid down, there comes my dad’s boss from the side door, and he hollers at my\n",
      "dad, “There is your boy.” He had a goofy suit on, like a bail bondsman. They got\n",
      "me and took me in the car, and we went up to Butler. That’s where we lived.\n",
      "JZ: When did your dad come here?\n",
      "AC: 1909.\n",
      "JZ: 1909?\n",
      "AC: He made three trips over there. First one when he got married, and then back over\n",
      "there. And then he came over in 1923, that’s when I was born. Then he came over\n",
      "in 1928, that’s when my brother was born.\n",
      "JZ: What was he doing here?\n",
      "AC: Coal mining.\n",
      "JZ: Up in Butler County?\n",
      "AC: All over the place. He worked all over these coal mines.\n",
      "2\n",
      "JZ: So when he picked you up at the station, you went to where he lived?\n",
      "AC: Yeah, he worked in a coal mine up there.\n",
      "JZ: Was that Chicora?\n",
      "AC: In Ford City.\n",
      "JZ: Okay, because I have relatives in Chicora.\n",
      "AC: Do you? My dad’s boss’s wife, she use to pick me up where we were living and\n",
      "she use to take me to church in Chicora. He enrolled me in to school up there in\n",
      "Ford City. I was sixteen years old. They put me in eighth grade because one of the\n",
      "boss’s sons spoke Italian. So they used him as an interpreter. I didn’t know what I\n",
      "was talking about, and I went to school for one year up there. I just sat down,\n",
      "that’s all I did, and drew pictures. June came, everybody was graduating. I go\n",
      "home and my dad says, “What did you learn anyhow? Did you learn anything in\n",
      "school?” I said, “Shit, I didn’t learn anything.” So he said, “We better get out of\n",
      "here.” So he came down to Rural Ridge, and he got me a job over there, he got a\n",
      "job over there. We stayed with some people over there, Italian people. My dad\n",
      "knew a lot of people at Universal. So I asked him, “You think you can give me a\n",
      "job over at the cement plant in Universal?” He said, “We’ll go over and see.” So\n",
      "we went over there and I got a job just like that. They were hiring then, because of\n",
      "the war going on. That’s 1940.\n",
      "JZ: Was your mom here at this time?\n",
      "AC: No my mother, sister, and brother were still over there.\n",
      "JZ: Still in Italy.\n",
      "AC: During the war even, I was over there when I landed. But they were still over\n",
      "there, my mother, brother, and sister. My sister got married in the meantime.\n",
      "JZ: What was it like in the Veneto when you were growing up?\n",
      "AC: Very poor. Everybody was very poor, everybody but the rich people. There were\n",
      "a lot of sharecroppers. They worked the farm. The owner would get half, and the\n",
      "sharecropper got half. Lots of them farms over there.\n",
      "3\n",
      "JZ: And you’re from, what’s the name of the village you’re from?\n",
      "AC: Belluno.\n",
      "JZ: Belluno and how big is it?\n",
      "AC: There were a lot of houses there. But I was born in Feltre, a town about eight\n",
      "miles north. Anyhow, I came over and got a job at a cement plant. I was a laborer.\n",
      "I started there sixty-three cents an hour. I was there eight months, and they drafted\n",
      "me in the army.\n",
      "JZ: And that would be ’41?\n",
      "AC: ’41, yeah. When they drafted me in the army I wasn’t even a citizen. You know\n",
      "where I got my citizen papers?\n",
      "JZ: In the army?\n",
      "AC: In Texas. I was down there for two years.\n",
      "JZ: Was your father an American citizen?\n",
      "AC: Yeah. 1934 he had his citizen papers. Anyhow, they drafted me in the army. I\n",
      "went to Fort Meade, Maryland. From there then we went to Texas, Camp\n",
      "Wallace. I took basic training and anti-aircraft out there. Then I stayed there, and\n",
      "everybody after thirteen weeks, everybody was shipping out. Whoever was going\n",
      "to radio school, whoever was going to artillery… I trained on a 90 millimeter gun\n",
      "and aircraft. Everybody shipped out except me and a little Jew fellow from\n",
      "Montana. I could not speak the language that well.\n",
      "JZ: Not at all?\n",
      "AC: I couldn’t read or write. So we lay around the base for about a week. I told the\n",
      "boy, “We better go over to see the old man.” I wanted to see what he wanted to do\n",
      "with us. I was afraid he was going to make us take basic training over again. That\n",
      "would have been a hell of job. So we went over. I knocked on the door, and\n",
      "walked in. He said, “What can I do for you this morning?” He was a nice guy. A\n",
      "nice guy. I said, “I was wondering what was going to happen to me and my\n",
      "buddy, because everybody got shipped out except us.” “Well,” he said, “You\n",
      "4\n",
      "can’t speak, you can’t get around too well, you can’t speak the language too\n",
      "well.” He says, “Just go back to the barracks and we’ll call you when we need\n",
      "you.” So I did, and he told the other fellow the same thing. So I went back to the\n",
      "barracks, and four hours later he sent another man over, and that man said, “He\n",
      "wants to see you.” So we went over there. He said, “We’re going to get a new\n",
      "bunch of trainees for thirteen weeks, and the supply sergeant back there will need\n",
      "some help. You two guys go back there and help him.” So he had a corporal and a\n",
      "mailman for the battery area. So he went back to his office and then came back\n",
      "about an hour later and said, “Come here.” He took me over to the corporal’s desk\n",
      "in the supply room. He said, “You work for so and so, and see what you can\n",
      "learn.” This was on a Wednesday. He says, “Work for him for a few days, and see\n",
      "what you can learn.” So this corporal had all these guys who went out, addresses\n",
      "written down in a file and he had all the names of the new guys coming in. So on\n",
      "Friday he came in and says, “Cestoni, the mail is all yours.” I says, “Sir I didn’t\n",
      "learn nothing!” He said, “Well you’re going to learn something. If you need any\n",
      "help, corporal so and so will help you out.” I said okay, and I was there for the\n",
      "whole thirteen weeks. He made me PFC, and I was taking care of the mail, and he\n",
      "had everything written down. When the guys were going out, he had all the new\n",
      "addresses and where they went. He says, “If you get their mail, just scratch their\n",
      "address out, and put it down below for their new address. Then put it back in the\n",
      "bag, and take it back up.” And so I became a mailman.\n",
      "JZ: And this is in Camp Wallace, Texas?\n",
      "AC: Yeah, Camp Wallace. That was the last of the training center. They broke up the\n",
      "outfit and different guys got sent to different outfits. It was about five of us that\n",
      "got sent to the 99th Division.\n",
      "JZ: How did you get by, since you didn’t speak English really well? How did you\n",
      "communicate the best you could?\n",
      "AC: After I was in there for a while, I had to learn the language, because I couldn’t\n",
      "speak to anybody unless I spoke English. I couldn’t speak Italian to nobody in\n",
      "there. We got sent to the camp in Texas, the 99th Infantry Division. And there I\n",
      "wound up in the 81 millimeter motor platoon.\n",
      "JZ: And what did you do?\n",
      "AC: I helped two or three guys to operate the gun. Then our section sergeant got hurt,\n",
      "so they moved our section sergeant up and I moved up to first gunner. And the old\n",
      "5\n",
      "man, the captain, says to me one day, “If I gave you a test, Cestoni, do you think\n",
      "you can pass it and be a first gunner?” And that’s what I wanted most in life, was\n",
      "to get a call for corporal. So I got out of KP duty, I got out of guard duty, all they\n",
      "had to was corporal of the guard. He said, “We can try, set the gun up in between\n",
      "the barracks and come over and tell me when you’re ready. I’ll get a guy to move\n",
      "the sticks for the setup.” So I setup and went over and called him, he came over\n",
      "and says, “All right, start.” Boom, boom, boom, boom. And he said, “You’re now\n",
      "a first gunner, Corporal Cestoni.” So I was a first gunner until we got over in\n",
      "Harare Park in Germany. Our section sergeant got hit. The first jet we seen in\n",
      "Germany in Harare Park, it was like a little plane.\n",
      "JZ: A German jet?\n",
      "AC: A German jet came over. He was thrown out of the army personal mines. We\n",
      "lined up in a god damned open field. And we crawled under some of the tanks we\n",
      "were with, under the jeeps. Our section sergeant got hit, again. So they took my\n",
      "squad leader again and made him section sergeant, and I became the acting squad\n",
      "leader. So I had to dig no more gun emplacements. I had to carry no more guns,\n",
      "but I was still the first gunner on a gun. We went over, the boss of Massachusetts,\n",
      "and I spent my 21st birthday on the train going to Boston. So when I got up there,\n",
      "the only thing I’d hear was my dad and some girl. They use to write to me.\n",
      "JZ: Did your mom know that you were in the army?\n",
      "AC: I’ll come to that in a minute. I was going to Boston and we were on the coast, and\n",
      "the captain came through, and he liked me. He liked me. I stopped him and said,\n",
      "“Hey captain, today I’m 21 years old. When I get up to Boston can I get a three\n",
      "day pass to go home to Pennsylvania to see my dad?” He said, “Oh no, we are on\n",
      "shipping orders, no passes, no nothing.” So we went onto the ship and then we\n",
      "landed in South Hampton, England. They put us in a camp over there. He came\n",
      "through the barracks; it was three weeks before D-Day, and he said, “Cestoni,\n",
      "how would you like to go to London on a three day pass?” I said “Sir, I went\n",
      "broke coming over here playing blackjack on the ship. I don’t have two pennies to\n",
      "rub together.” He said, “I’ll give you the money, I want you to go on a three day\n",
      "pass to London.” So it wound up that he gave me the money. He gave me fifteen\n",
      "pounds, which was the equivalent of four dollars a pound then. And he said, “I\n",
      "want you to go to London and spend three days, and then when you come back\n",
      "we’ll see what’s up.” I went to London for three days, and then I went back. I\n",
      "meet a kid from the Air Force, me and him running around for three days\n",
      "together. We didn’t even get a hotel room. We stayed at the USO. We split the\n",
      "6\n",
      "USO. We went back, and D-Day came, D-Day plus four, we went in to the\n",
      "harbor. Not Normandy, in Le Havre, France.\n",
      "JZ: So the Americans, did they land in Le Havre, no?\n",
      "AC: No.\n",
      "JZ: That was with the British.\n",
      "AC: But it was right over, we went in and no one got shot. They already took some of\n",
      "it from the other side.\n",
      "JZ: Oh, the Germans had already pulled out.\n",
      "AC: Yeah.\n",
      "JZ: What were your thoughts going on, when D-Day was going on?\n",
      "AC: No thoughts. We were there, and it was just one of those things.\n",
      "JZ: What were your feelings?\n",
      "AC: I was in 36 months, 14 months over there during the war. And I never served\n",
      "another act of duty.\n",
      "JZ: KP, or…\n",
      "AC: You know I got penalized. We went in Le Havre, and four days we were in the\n",
      "secret line. We got behind, and they took Paris and went on. We went up to the\n",
      "secret line. We were leading the 9th Division. They took them that far, and our\n",
      "division would lead their division. There was nine inches of snow. We pulled in\n",
      "around this time at night, and there were guns, and holes in the ground. We had to\n",
      "place tents in the nine inches of snow. Until the next morning the guys pulled\n",
      "down, and we pulled in for placement. And the holes in the ground, this was in\n",
      "the pine forest. We had to set up in an open field, we had to sleep in quarters, and\n",
      "they had to sleep in quarters, in the woods and pines. We were there holding the\n",
      "line for about four weeks. They set up a kitchen there. We had hot food everyday,\n",
      "and we use to go out on patrol to check here and there.\n",
      "JZ: So you were with a molder crew?\n",
      "7\n",
      "AC: But it was always about 3,000 yards back from the rifle company, from the front\n",
      "line.\n",
      "JZ: What kind of personal arms did you have? Did you have an M-1?\n",
      "AC: I had a .45 pistol.\n",
      "JZ: Just a .45?\n",
      "AC: Yeah.\n",
      "JZ: Did you carry ammunitions? What did you do?\n",
      "AC: I had to carry the tripod, and the guy carried the tube, and another guy carried the\n",
      "base plate. With the base plate that weighed 46 pounds. We were there all those\n",
      "weeks, and they had a kitchen set up made out of logs. They had the regular hot\n",
      "water, garbage cans. We had hot food for the whole three and four weeks. And\n",
      "our captain, that guy that liked me. He would stand in the kitchen watching the\n",
      "KPs washing those cans, those garbage cans out for the next meal. And a mortar\n",
      "shell comes in, and goes right through his chest.\n",
      "JZ: Wow.\n",
      "AC: They took him back and they told me he was dead before they even got him back\n",
      "there. The man that was under him took over, and I had a hell of a good first\n",
      "sergeant. He’s still living. He lives down in Florida.\n",
      "JZ: Yeah?\n",
      "AC: So the on the 16th we were in the holes before daylight arrived, at five o’clock.\n",
      "We knew something was coming. Man, there was shells coming, and mortars, all\n",
      "kind of shit. Everybody grabbed their guns. We went out to the gun\n",
      "emplacements. The guns were across the street. It was still just getting daylight,\n",
      "and here comes the first sergeant. I was the only guy left that could fire a bazooka.\n",
      "He said, “Cestoni come on, come with me.” He took me down to the CP, and he\n",
      "had an ammunition bird down there, a carrier. He said “Go down to the jeep, get\n",
      "the bazooka out of the jeep and all the shells and report up here.” We had twenty\n",
      "jeeps to carry all those guns. So I went down to get the bazooka and the two\n",
      "8\n",
      "rounds, and this kid from Ohio was there. He took us over along the pines to the\n",
      "CP.\n",
      "JZ: What is the CP?\n",
      "AC: It’s the company headquarters. He talked to the squad leader of the rifle company,\n",
      "and he took one of the rifle men out of there, one that was overlooking one of\n",
      "these open spots in the woods. And he told that kid to go with him. He said, “You\n",
      "two dig a hole big enough for the both of you.” Because the original hole wasn’t\n",
      "big enough for him, so we dug the hole big enough for the both of us to get in.\n",
      "But the bazooka didn’t fit in there. For me it was too long. So we threw out some\n",
      "dirt to fit the bazooka in there. We got down there in the hole, and it started to get\n",
      "daylight. The fire from the artillery was coming in. It was still a little dark. You\n",
      "would see flames go up, and pine trees go up. We looked down the road. There\n",
      "was a crossroads down there, 400 to 500 yards from where we were situated on a\n",
      "dirt road. There was a bunch of Germans down there throwing their arms around.\n",
      "We could see them from where we were. Pretty soon those big tiger tanks were\n",
      "coming up the road. They were coming up and there were three of them. About\n",
      "twenty soldiers were along each side walking the ditch. There was another shot\n",
      "fired. They were as close as from here to that house. But nobody fired a shot; they\n",
      "knew where we were, and we could see them coming, but nobody fired. So this\n",
      "kid said, “Hey Enzo give it to them.” They were going very slow because they\n",
      "didn’t know where we were. So I fired, and a big splash of fire went up in the air.\n",
      "And it was making a noise. It must have knocked the track off. But they were still\n",
      "firing a machine gun of the top of that tank, and then everybody broke lose. Thirty\n",
      "caliber machine gun, the air crew, and we had rifle companies; everybody was\n",
      "involved. They were shooting out eighty-eights, that had eighty-eight guns on it.\n",
      "JZ: Okay, on the tiger?\n",
      "AC: Yeah. They were shooting into those god damned pines out there. You would see\n",
      "those pines go up. One of those pines went down along side a hole. So this kid\n",
      "loaded the bazooka up with the second shell he had and he says, “That’s the last\n",
      "one Angelo.” The way things were going, I rose up to shoot another one, and I felt\n",
      "something hit me, and there was blood coming down my field jacket. So I went,\n",
      "“Hey Pino, am I hit bad?” He said, “No, no, do what you were doing.” It went\n",
      "through my ear, and it burned the ear when it came out. So he said, “Do what you\n",
      "were doing.” I didn’t even aim that sucker, and I raised it up and went, “Boom.” I\n",
      "said that we’re going to need to go back, to see if we have any more shells. I said,\n",
      "“Let me back there, I’ll go.” He said, “No, no. I’ll go.” So I stuck my steel\n",
      "9\n",
      "hammer up. I told him, “Don’t run, crawl out.” He got up and started running. He\n",
      "didn’t go from me to you. “Boom.” He got his face in the snow, and I watched\n",
      "him for a little bit. He wasn’t moving. Pretty soon here comes a guy crawling\n",
      "from the direction where the CP was, where the gunning placement was. He came\n",
      "crawling out and said, “You need any help?” I said, “No, get your ass out of here.\n",
      "I’ll get mine out of here, if we can do it.” I raised up to see what the hell was\n",
      "coming. I see a German running over with a tripod, another one brought the\n",
      "machine gun over, and another brought the ammunition. From here to the door.\n",
      "I said, “That son of a bitch.” They were setting up. So I went boom, boom\n",
      "[motions like firing]. I got the ammunition carrier, and I got the other guy. Then I\n",
      "went down because hell broke loose. They knew I was there, and my buddy was\n",
      "laying there in the snow, in nine inches of snow. He’s laying there in the snow,\n",
      "and he wasn’t moving. So this guy that came crawling out said, “How about your\n",
      "buddy?” I said, “My buddy is out of here, I’ve been watching him for about two,\n",
      "three minutes. He never moved.” He said, “I’ll grab him and drag him out of here,\n",
      "and you get your ass out of here.” So he took him, and took him down to the CB,\n",
      "to the aid station. Down over the hill they had the aid station dug in on the side of\n",
      "the hill, looking away from where the Germans were coming. So the only way I\n",
      "could get out of there… I stuck a steel hammer up again on the bazooka shell\n",
      "container. This was alongside the tree that fell. They didn’t shoot it, so I said, “I’ll\n",
      "take a chance.” But I crawled out of there; I had two shirts on, the field jacket,\n",
      "because it was cold.\n",
      "JZ: Right.\n",
      "AC: When I got back to the CP, it was from here to the open pantry up here. I had no\n",
      "more clothes here.\n",
      "JZ: None.\n",
      "AC: I walked in the CP, and I passed out.\n",
      "JZ: You were still bleeding now from…\n",
      "AC: Oh yeah.\n",
      "JZ: And that was your only wound?\n",
      "AC: Yeah.\n",
      "10\n",
      "JZ: What were you thinking, what were you feeling?\n",
      "AC: You don’t feel it. My opinion, now I don’t know about other people, but we had a\n",
      "job, and we were there to do a job, and we thought nothing. We looked at it as a\n",
      "job, like going to work eight hours, do your job and that’s it. We never gave it a\n",
      "thought.\n",
      "JZ: In combat there was no time to think, or feel. Just to react, right?\n",
      "AC: We were shooting an eighty-one when they moved across the road. They brought\n",
      "the rifle guns when they moved across the road. We were shooting eighty light\n",
      "shells and a motor in eighty-one, that was three inches in diameter let alone. Then\n",
      "we had white phosphorous, and when that sucker hit, especially if it hit three\n",
      "birds, it was a good chance they were in the pines. We were shooting them. We\n",
      "saw them go straight up and then come down, and then go off. You would see a\n",
      "big cloud of smoke over there, and then you would hear those Germans\n",
      "screaming. The white phosphorous was designed that if it got on your skin, hands,\n",
      "or neck, the more you scratched it, the more deep it went, and the more it burned.\n",
      "I got back to the CP, and another guy took me down to the aid station. I walk in\n",
      "the aid station, with them guys helping me. I was all banged up. And there was\n",
      "my buddy; they had him up on a stool.\n",
      "JZ: He got hit?\n",
      "AC: In the head. You could put an egg from where it came out.\n",
      "JZ: Wow. That was the guy in the fox hole with you.\n",
      "AC: Yeah, the guy loading the bazooka.\n",
      "JZ: So he made it, did he make it?\n",
      "AC: Oh yeah, he was alive. They took care of him, and they took care of me. And\n",
      "when all this went on, there was a guy that came in. He said, “If anybody can\n",
      "walk, they off and walk on back.” They were withdrawing. When I knocked that\n",
      "tank out, the other three could not get off the road. They were afraid of the mines,\n",
      "so they could not come any farther. This gave the whole company a chance to get\n",
      "out of there; otherwise they were going to go down that crossroad. Anyhow, they\n",
      "said, “If anybody can walk, take off.” So I came out, and there was a guy sitting\n",
      "there on a log. I didn’t know what was going on. He got shot through the mouth,\n",
      "11\n",
      "and it came back through his ears. It busted both of his ear drums. He could not\n",
      "hear anything. He was on a machine gun, so I grabbed him, and there was a team\n",
      "of four guys on a jeep, ready to take off back to town. So I put him on the hood of\n",
      "the jeep, and I went in the back. I put my foot on the tailgate and the other over\n",
      "the railing on the jeep. And when I put my foot up, some guy sat on my leg. And\n",
      "he said “Take off.” We went down the road and went down along the hillside.\n",
      "There was a T down there. We had to turn left to go back to safe territory. That\n",
      "guy made that bend, that T, on two wheels, with all those guys on that jeep. There\n",
      "was a man going on the side of the hill, a German with an automatic gun. He\n",
      "made that bend and I got my back to it. He didn’t hit any of us on the jeep. There\n",
      "were potholes on the damn dirt road, and everybody was like “Go, Go, Go,” and I\n",
      "said, “Stop, I got to get my leg out.” So I went on, we went back to the town, and\n",
      "they passed me up again. They had the ambulance going to Lyon to the hospital.\n",
      "They had all the roads shut off, the Germans. We could not get out.\n",
      "JZ: Was this the night of the Bulge, the Battle of the Bulge?\n",
      "AC: Yeah. That was on the 16th. We went back in, and they passed me out and they\n",
      "sent me downstairs to the cellar with another guy. My hand to God, I’m telling\n",
      "you the truth. And we are down there and it was getting dark. We heard a lot of\n",
      "commotion, a lot of jeeps and trucks leaving the town, a little town. And we’re\n",
      "down in the cellar. We didn’t know what was going on, and I said, “Hey buddy,\n",
      "we better go up and go see what’s going on.” We go up there, and there was one\n",
      "last vehicle out of the town. The next morning the town belonged to the Germans;\n",
      "they took it over. We made it back to division headquarters. They took us. I\n",
      "stayed there six days, until Christmas Eve. The whole room was full of crippled\n",
      "GIs, but I was still walking around. So this one day, one of the persons came up\n",
      "and said, “Cestoni, they finally opened the roads up, you can go back to the\n",
      "hospital.” He put a tag on me, and I was walking down the sidewalk in the little\n",
      "town, and here comes a guy with a whip. And I looked at him and said, “I know\n",
      "that son of a gun.” I didn’t know how many from our company were left, or\n",
      "anything. I said, “Where the hell you going?” He said “I’m looking for a company\n",
      "motor board.” He took care of the motor vehicles. I said, “I know where they are\n",
      "at, they are on top of the hill, and I’ll go with you.” Then the medic said, “Hey\n",
      "you can’t go with him, you need to go to the hospital.” I said “No way, I’m going\n",
      "the other way.” So yeah, I never went to the hospital. I went up there and out of\n",
      "158 of us, in two days there was 33 of us left. I got up there, and a couple other\n",
      "guys were up there and some drivers from the jeeps, they had some jeeps left\n",
      "over. Christmas Eve they were bringing up, they finally stopped the Germans up.\n",
      "They dug in and set up. So we went up there. They told me that I had to go back\n",
      "12\n",
      "with my outfit. I was well enough then after six days. So I took six blankets, all\n",
      "new clothes, and I went up where they were digging in on the side of the hill.\n",
      "They brought me up there with a horse and a sled, to the crew and the guns, so I\n",
      "went up with them. I went up there, and the number one squad where my guys\n",
      "were supposed to be, what was left of them, they had a hole dug in. In the ground\n",
      "with logs over it, and then with pine and snow over it. A little hole was left. They\n",
      "could get in and out. There were four in each hole, in each gun emplacement. So I\n",
      "went over to the first squad were I belonged, where I was supposed to be. I said,\n",
      "“Do you have enough room in there for one more?” They said “No, get the hell\n",
      "out of here.” I go to the nest emplacement, and the same thing. I said, “You guys\n",
      "kiss my butt.” I got a shovel off the jeep and I dug a hole in the ground about that\n",
      "deep. [gestures] I put three blankets down, and three on top of me, and I went to\n",
      "sleep. I woke up the next morning and I had covered my head up with them\n",
      "blankets. I had to rip them from me breathing through them. I could not get that\n",
      "god darned thing open. So I got it open, and we got all new guns and everything.\n",
      "We were there for about a week and a half, and then they put a fence on. We got\n",
      "up and took that ground where we got pushed out, and some of those guys had\n",
      "pictures of their girlfriends and wives up on the little shelves. They went back and\n",
      "got those pictures; there were three guys who never made it out of there, and they\n",
      "got shot right in the emplacement. We went through there and then we got a two\n",
      "day’s rest.\n",
      "JZ: So by this time you were pushing the Germans back?\n",
      "AC: Back by the Rhine River by then, all through Belgium, and into Germany. We had\n",
      "a little river to cross; we were supposed to cross this little river. And there was no\n",
      "way that we could get it to support our artillery, in order for it to go across that\n",
      "little river. We didn’t, but they crossed on canoe boats, regular rowing boats. On\n",
      "the way in, the guys used to raid every little town we got to. They used to raid\n",
      "those houses in the middle of those little towns. They had a sack full of Kodiak in\n",
      "every jeep that we had!\n",
      "JZ: Wow.\n",
      "AC: So we were there for about a day and a half before we decided to cross. I was the\n",
      "only guy who wasn’t drunk. The lieutenant came to me, and said, “Cestoni. Come\n",
      "with me, we have eight guns over there. We are supposed to give them support to\n",
      "go across the river tomorrow morning.”\n",
      "[End Tape 1, Side A]\n",
      "13\n",
      "[Begin Tape 1, Side B]\n",
      "…So I helped him with all eight of those guns. He almost kissed me. He said,\n",
      "“Thanks a lot.” The next morning across the river, we get over and it took us\n",
      "about a week and a half to two weeks to finish that up.\n",
      "JZ: So you crossed the Rhine River, was this at Remagen?\n",
      "AC: Yeah at Remagen. There was a railroad bridge.\n",
      "JZ: Okay.\n",
      "AC: And the tank went over, it was probably a half hour ahead of us. We then went\n",
      "over. We carried our gun for seven miles. From the top of the mountain, down\n",
      "across the river, and the bridge, atop to the other side.\n",
      "JZ: Did you meet any resistance? The Germans?\n",
      "AC: We didn’t, but the tanks that went through, they cleaned them up. We got up\n",
      "there, we got held up. The German jet was coming over, trying to knock our\n",
      "bridge out.\n",
      "JZ: The jets?\n",
      "AC: No, just a regular fighter plane.\n",
      "JZ: Okay.\n",
      "AC: They had to have so much anti-aircraft to protect that bridge. It looked like a\n",
      "stream of fire going up, every time a plane came up. Eight to ten hours they had a\n",
      "pontoon bridge setup, with tanks and trucks and everything was going across. It\n",
      "was just below that railroad bridge.\n",
      "JZ: Okay.\n",
      "AC: We went on, and we got in the Ruhr pocket. And we were there for about ten to\n",
      "twelve days. And they finally closed in. There was a division that was all trapped\n",
      "in there. Our division was one of them.\n",
      "14\n",
      "JZ: When you say Ruhr pocket, they had you surrounded?\n",
      "AC: No. They had enough soldiers there that if they wanted, they could have kicked\n",
      "the shit out of us with a baseball bat. But they gave up, so we finished, and the\n",
      "rest went on in. They were still going. One day, all that day, and all that night, and\n",
      "that next day. There were enough soldiers that came through there where we\n",
      "were, they were all prisoners going back.\n",
      "JZ: Surrenders.\n",
      "AC: And there were tanks and everything else. But from the section where we were,\n",
      "we could hear the other 84th Division from the other side of the Pocket. The\n",
      "artillery was going off. We knew it was going to soon come in. They closed in,\n",
      "and all those things got out of there. We then kept on going; we finished up in\n",
      "Bavaria, Germany. That’s where the war ended. We had to join the tank outfit, but\n",
      "Christ, they were going through there. We pull up to a little town and they said,\n",
      "“All right, pull off the road.” They called in the Air Force; they were giving us a\n",
      "little resistance. About four passes, they said, “Move out.” There was a big pile of\n",
      "smoke going up. It knocked their objective off, and those guys moved out.\n",
      "JZ: What did you think of Patton? Did you like him? Was he a good man?\n",
      "AC: Well we didn’t hear too much about him. We knew he was commanding general\n",
      "of the tank outfit, but we didn’t know him. We didn’t get Stars and Stripes. We\n",
      "didn’t get anything.\n",
      "JZ: No Stars and Stripes, nothing? No news?\n",
      "AC: No, you didn’t get anything up there. We got in on the other side after we left the\n",
      "Ruhr pocket. We were back in that little town for three days, and that’s when we\n",
      "went down to join Patton’s armor outfit. We rode for two days and one night, in\n",
      "the rain, in the back of those god darned jeeps. And the rain was pouring down.\n",
      "To go from one section to the other. We got down there, and there was no\n",
      "problem.\n",
      "JZ: Nothing?\n",
      "AC: We go along the road; you would see a pile of dirt, the tank would come along,\n",
      "and they are there trying to knock tanks out. He would be laying there. A lot of\n",
      "15\n",
      "places we saw the people come out of the house, to drag them guys in the house.\n",
      "The German soldiers.\n",
      "JZ: The German soldiers.\n",
      "AC: Yeah, they were dead, they were finished.\n",
      "JZ: What did you think of the German soldiers?\n",
      "AC: At that time, the best trained men in the world.\n",
      "JZ: Yeah?\n",
      "AC: Yes.\n",
      "JZ: Who made them the best trained, the discipline?\n",
      "AC: The discipline, and everything. We pulled up on top of the hill. There were two\n",
      "emplacements that they had dug in on the side of hill, on the back of the hill from\n",
      "where we were going, and we finally took their territory. We crawled in some\n",
      "holes. They had bread as hard as a brick. We pulled it out, we couldn’t figure out\n",
      "how the hell they could eat it. They probably broke it with a knife or something,\n",
      "and suck away at it. But it was part of army life. When the war ended, you had to\n",
      "have 75 points to come back to the state of the division.\n",
      "JZ: How many points did you have?\n",
      "AC: 73.\n",
      "JZ: Oh man!\n",
      "AC: I wound up in a depot in Belgium. To go over to Japan, to go over to the Pacific.\n",
      "JZ: They told you, you were going to the Pacific?\n",
      "AC: The replacement center.\n",
      "JZ: Okay.\n",
      "16\n",
      "AC: We were there waiting there for a ship to go over there and the war ended in\n",
      "Japan. It must have been ten thousand GIs waiting for that ship.\n",
      "JZ: In Belgium?\n",
      "AC: In Belgium. To go to [Newport?], Belgium, to then go to Japan. And I always\n",
      "said, “Man can live through one war, but he can’t live through two of them.” You\n",
      "should have seen that town the night they declared the Japanese had surrendered.\n",
      "They toured that town, for all the GIs that were there. They were so happy, so\n",
      "glad. We went from there; they sent us to one of those cigarette camps, Camp\n",
      "Lucky Strike.\n",
      "JZ: Okay, I heard of that.\n",
      "AC: You heard of that?\n",
      "JZ: Yeah that was the camp before you went back to the States right?\n",
      "AC: Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "JZ: Was that in France?\n",
      "AC: Yeah in France, right alongside the town line. I was there for about five weeks\n",
      "waiting for a ship to come back to the States.\n",
      "JZ: Five weeks?\n",
      "AC: We didn’t have a job. We lived off coffee and donuts.\n",
      "JZ: Really?\n",
      "AC: Honest to God. To pass the time, we used to go along that shore, the Chunnel. The\n",
      "Germans had them field boxes built in. You should have seen the concrete in\n",
      "them bunkers. Pathetic. They would be as big as this house, solid concrete. Just a\n",
      "little opening overlooking the Chunnel, but there were no more guns. They took\n",
      "them out of there when they pulled out of there, I guess. So I got sent to the\n",
      "railroad battalion. I was attached to the railroad battalion. I went up to place the\n",
      "guards and I got soaked to the ass. I went in to the guard house and I went to\n",
      "sleep. About a week or two later, I started to cough, and sneezing, and we got a\n",
      "ship to come back. I had a sore throat, the coughing, and the sneezing; they used\n",
      "17\n",
      "to send me to the medics. They gave me two or three aspirins, and sprayed my\n",
      "throat. That’s all. It took us eight to nine days to come back. We came back on a\n",
      "banana boat. We pulled in to New York.\n",
      "JZ: What did you say, banana boat?\n",
      "AC: Yeah.\n",
      "JZ: What’s that?\n",
      "AC: A Sea Cat, one of those small ships.\n",
      "JZ: Oh yeah.\n",
      "AC: They sent us to Fort Meade, where we were to get separated two weeks before\n",
      "Christmas. There was thirty-three of us that went to the aid station for check up.\n",
      "Thirty-three went in, thirty-three came out, and they said, “You guys wait out\n",
      "there for a little bit.” Out of thirty-three guys, guess who they called out –\n",
      "Cestoni. I was looking to get home. I went in, and the commanding officer there\n",
      "at the desk said, “We found a spot on your lungs, and we don’t know what it is.\n",
      "We’ve got to take another X-Ray.” I went in for the X-Ray. I came out and he\n",
      "read the X-Ray and said, “There is something wrong; that spot should not be\n",
      "there. You can’t get discharged.” This was on a Friday, so they didn’t accept no\n",
      "patients in the hospital on Saturdays and Sundays. So they sent me over to some\n",
      "bag over there, to stay there until Monday, and go get admitted in the hospital. I\n",
      "go in the hospital. They take me down for a TB ward, and if you had TB they\n",
      "checked you out. I got to talk to some of those guys that were in there. They said,\n",
      "“If you got TB, they will send you straight to New Mexico. You’ll never see\n",
      "home.” This was for a cure. Just think that I spent there the whole weekend, and\n",
      "two more weeks. So I went in to the hospital and they put me in a ward, in the TB\n",
      "ward. They gave me a test, and checked this, and that. I got better in two weeks.\n",
      "JZ: Thank God.\n",
      "AC: The day before Christmas, before Christmas Eve, the medical officer came\n",
      "around. I was the first bed near the office. He said, “Cestoni. How would you like\n",
      "to have a three day pass?” I said, “No way, I’d liked to get discharged.” He said,\n",
      "“We’re not sure about you. I want you to go up to the aid station and get an X-\n",
      "Ray and wait for it to bring it back.” They would read it and do a report on it. I\n",
      "came back. I went up there and took the X-Ray, and then the girl put the X-Ray in\n",
      "18\n",
      "a brown envelope. She typed outside on a little piece paper and they read it up\n",
      "there I guess. It was in the morning, and I got cleared up in the next fifteen days. I\n",
      "had to go from across the road up there, down to the boardwalk. I was jumping up\n",
      "high. [Laughs]. I was so happy, because as a kid in the morning I would in Italy. I\n",
      "went in, and I put it on his desk, and said, “It looks pretty good Cestoni. Maybe\n",
      "you better go home and then come back for a check up.” I said, “No, no, no, no. I\n",
      "want to go home, discharged.” He said, “It’s up to you, you know. If you go home\n",
      "and catch another cold in the next two months, you’ll be back in the same booth.”\n",
      "I said, “Don’t worry about it, Angelo will take care of it.” So I got discharged. I\n",
      "got home Christmas Eve.\n",
      "JZ: What a perfect Christmas gift.\n",
      "AC: Yeah. [Laughs]. This girl that used to write to me, she lived in Homewood, her\n",
      "and her dad came down to pick me up, down at Pennsylvania Station. I went with\n",
      "her a couple more months, and then we broke up. Then I meet that lady right\n",
      "there, two years later.\n",
      "JZ: Where was this at, here in Pittsburgh?\n",
      "AC: Yeah in Larimer Avenue.\n",
      "JZ: Oh yeah.\n",
      "AC: Yeah. She lived off Larimer Avenue, on 40th street. A little dago. A little\n",
      "Calabrese.\n",
      "JZ: Calabrese [Laughs].\n",
      "AC: What’s your first name?\n",
      "JZ: Jim Zanella.\n",
      "AC: Jim, I put fifty years in with her. And you couldn’t have found a better human\n",
      "being. She waited on me head to foot, she raised three kids. I worked everyday.\n",
      "We had our first kid, and I said, “We’ll need to learn how to live off what I\n",
      "make.” Because over in Italy, that’s how they put up with it. Now I got three\n",
      "daughters, and grandkids. You see that kid over there; he got three years in to\n",
      "CMU.\n",
      "19\n",
      "JZ: Great, good for him.\n",
      "AC: And we raised him, me and my wife.\n",
      "JZ: Did you?\n",
      "AC: My daughter worked at Western Psych, she got a job down there. She got thirty\n",
      "years in at Western Psych. She had the baby, and she would come home. Three\n",
      "months later she came over, and her mother was in the kitchen. She said, “Mom\n",
      "do you think you can watch John for me while I go back to work?” I know my\n",
      "wife couldn’t say no to nobody, so she said to me, my wife said to me, “What do\n",
      "you think Angelo?” I said, “You’re going to watch him, it’s up to you.” I was\n",
      "working a shift over at the mill, so we watched him for five days a week. We\n",
      "went away on vacation, we took him with us. We have a camp up in Brockway.\n",
      "We used to go up to camp every Fourth of July. For 38 years me and her went up\n",
      "to camp, even when our kids were small. She made some friends. I made some\n",
      "friends up there, very good friends. I put in fifty years in with her. My father came\n",
      "up with brain tumor, in three months time he was gone.\n",
      "JZ: Sorry to hear that.\n",
      "AC: So I got three daughters, and they all live around here. The second daughter, I’ve\n",
      "been going to her house since my wife passed away every Sunday, for dinner. She\n",
      "cooks up baby ribs, and chicken, and sauce, and baked potatoes, and this and that.\n",
      "On Sunday I come home with two bags, every Sunday. [Laughs]\n",
      "JZ: Have enough to eat for the week.\n",
      "AC: For the whole week. My wife, it’s going to be six years on June 23rd, and I don’t\n",
      "know how to turn that oven on. I’ve been living here by myself ever since. Time\n",
      "is numbered. What the hell you going to do?\n",
      "JZ: Well you raised a wonderful family.\n",
      "AC: I said years ago, in my small way of doing it, living, I could not afford it. I\n",
      "worked in a mill, I raised three kids, and I paid for their shack. I did what a lot of\n",
      "guys probably never done in life. I hunted small game. I hunted deer, bear, and\n",
      "turkey. I played golf; I used to play twice a week. I fished trout. Did you see the\n",
      "one up there?\n",
      "20\n",
      "JZ: Yes.\n",
      "AC: I got one bigger then that down in the freezer. This guy that was supposed to\n",
      "mount it for me five years ago and it’s still down there. I like to fish trout for\n",
      "about eight, nine weeks. Then they call me, and they want me to go play golf.\n",
      "And I bowl in two leagues.\n",
      "JZ: Yeah.\n",
      "AC: But like I said, my scale of living, I could have died twenty years ago. And I lived\n",
      "a good life.\n",
      "JZ: You sure did. Good man.\n",
      "AC: I retired. They shut the place down there, US Steel mill, and I was 57 years old. I\n",
      "told my wife I was going to retire that fall in August anyhow. I was going to take\n",
      "my pension; I had 40 years in. They asked me if I wanted to be transferred down\n",
      "to Homestead Steel, or National Tube. I said, “Hell no.” So I took my pension. I\n",
      "began at 62 with Social Security. In our way of living we had more then we could\n",
      "spend.\n",
      "JZ: Tell me a little bit about when you got your Distinguished Service Cross. Were\n",
      "you still a soldier?\n",
      "AC: I didn’t tell you that? After the Ruhr, when we got pit stopped, we had three day’s\n",
      "rest. My hand to God now, we were in a little town living in a house. We chased\n",
      "the Germans out, and we were living in the houses. And they decided to award me\n",
      "that Distinguished Service Cross. So they had a battalion formation one day, and\n",
      "all the guys in my platoon, in my company, had to participate, the battalion, and\n",
      "the rifle company, all of them. So they said, “Everybody wash, clean them up, get\n",
      "ready. We are going to have a formation tomorrow for General so-and-so. He was\n",
      "supposed to come down and award Cestoni that Distinguished Service Cross.”\n",
      "They gave me new shoes, new boots, new everything. Them guys were going to\n",
      "kill me. [Laughs] Look what we go to go through, all because of you. So they had\n",
      "a formation out there, and I was out there. They put me out in the front of the\n",
      "formation, and this General with all these big shots came down. And I had to\n",
      "stand before them. They ordered to advance over to him, and he went “zoom,\n",
      "zoom, zoom,” and he put it on. There it is up there.\n",
      "JZ: It’s up there, yeah.\n",
      "21\n",
      "AC: But yeah, they were going to kill me that day. So they gave me the medal, and I\n",
      "took it with me and I sent it home to my dad.\n",
      "JZ: You sent it home, yeah.\n",
      "AC: Yeah.\n",
      "JZ: Did your father get in contact with your mom, and your family?\n",
      "AC: I was in army occupation for four months in Germany, before they decided to\n",
      "send that division back to the States. That’s when I got sent over. We were in\n",
      "Germany for army occupation. They had a big school; the whole company was in\n",
      "there, our company in that school. Every weapon was coming, machine guns, and\n",
      "motors. And one day I got a letter from my GI, he had his own ABO from down\n",
      "in Italy. I opened it up. It was my sister that wrote the letter. But he put it in one\n",
      "of his envelopes, through his ABO, and it went to my ABO, and I got it over in\n",
      "Germany. I found out that all three of them, my mother, sister, and brother… my\n",
      "grandfather was still living, he died at 96 years old.\n",
      "JZ: He was a farmer?\n",
      "AC: Yeah, he had cattle. But during the Depression my dad wasn’t working, he\n",
      "couldn’t send any money. Then he got in an automobile wreck, he was in the\n",
      "hospital for 19 months, right up when the Depression started. So my grandfather\n",
      "kept us. He had to sell the farm, he had to sell everything. He lived until the day\n",
      "he died, anyhow. Some lady bought the farm, and mother and dad, and my sister\n",
      "were living in it. My brother was 19 when he came here, in ’47. I brought mother\n",
      "and brother over. My sister got married over there. She had two kids, so my dad\n",
      "said, in 1955, “We might as well bring her over, she’s writing letters crying that\n",
      "she misses the family.” So we brought her and the two kids, the two girls, and her\n",
      "husband over. She’s still living; she lives down on Frankston Road. Across from\n",
      "St. Bart’s church. But she’s three years older then me. She’s 84 years old. She’s\n",
      "like a machine and I’m telling you.\n",
      "JZ: Tough, right?\n",
      "AC: John?\n",
      "John: Oh yes.\n",

      "AC: You know what I call her. I say “You’re the Devil.”\n",
      "JZ: The devil.\n",
      "John: We think she was running around at 45 years old. She moves.\n",
      "AC: And she smokes.\n",
      "John: Like a freight train.\n",
      "AC: She comes here and she says, “Can I smoke?” I said “Yeah.” John and Jim across\n",
      "the street, they come in, they smoke. What the hell. I quit smoking 28 years ago.\n",
      "But my wife never smoked, and the same year I quit smoking, she was coughing\n",
      "like a horse. I quit smoking, she started coughing, for about six, seven years,\n",
      "longer than that. Yes she was coughing, from me, second hand smoking.\n",
      "JZ: I don’t want to get off the subject. But did you ever experience any… since you\n",
      "were Italian, did you ever experience an anti-Italian? Where they sometimes\n",
      "called you names, like discrimination?\n",
      "AC: I was in the army 36 months, and the only time they called me by my name was\n",
      "on pay day. You know what they called me – Dago.\n",
      "JZ: Everybody?\n",
      "AC: Everybody.\n",
      "JZ: And how did that make you feel?\n",
      "AC: It doesn’t bother me.\n",
      "JZ: It doesn’t bother you?\n",
      "AC: No, no, no.\n",
      "JZ: Okay.\n",
      "AC: You know how a Dago began, do you?\n",
      "23\n",
      "JZ: No.\n",
      "AC: Tell him John. There was a guy who came from Italy.\n",
      "JZ: Okay.\n",
      "AC: An old timer, he got a job picking shovel, digging ditches. And somebody asked\n",
      "him, “What did you do today Vince?” How he said “I worked pretty good, but a\n",
      "Dago.” He meant the day went, the “Day - go.” So Dago came out. That’s how\n",
      "that Dago name stuck to people’s head. But they never bothered me. There was a\n",
      "young fellow, a German; his dad ran a beer distributor up here on Universal. He\n",
      "was over in Germany during the war. He was a Hitler youth. In 1950 his dad\n",
      "brought him here, his dad had a bit of money. This German, I told him, “You\n",
      "German, you’re lucky I didn’t catch up with you over there, whenever you were a\n",
      "Hitler youth.” He was 17, 18 years old by the time the war ended. I said, “If I\n",
      "would have caught you over there, I would have shot you.” He became one of my\n",
      "best friends. I worked with him, we fished together, and we hunted together. We\n",
      "also associated family together. He lived over here on Jefferson Road. He married\n",
      "that girl over there; me and my wife used to go over a couple times a month.\n",
      "When I came from Italy, his wife she was that big. I worked for her dad. He ran a\n",
      "chicken farm, a greenhouse to grow tomatoes and corn. Summer time, the first\n",
      "summer I worked for him, and the second summer I worked for him. He paid me\n",
      "a dollar a day, and all I could eat. But it was better than what I was getting over in\n",
      "Italy. I was ten years old, I had to go out and work for the share croppers for just a\n",
      "piece of polenta and a piece of cheese.\n",
      "JZ: That’s it?\n",
      "AC: That’s it. Many times I’d walk in our kitchen, walk around the table, and walk\n",
      "back out. Believe me. But things turned out differently. I feel pretty lucky. I got\n",
      "over here, and I went over there, and I did what I had to do. I came back in one\n",
      "piece, and I raised a family. God I’m used to living down here with the old\n",
      "German fellow. He worked down in Verona. His dad was a tax collector in Penn\n",
      "Hills for years. And he was in the army, came out, and then went back to\n",
      "Edgewater. His dad passed away. He was the only son. So he got that whole mess,\n",
      "all that money. He quit working, and he went up to Muss, we use to loaf up at the\n",
      "Muss. We played cards, and bowled, or something. And many times he told me,\n",
      "“Angelo for being a foreigner, to come over here with nothing just with your\n",

      "say.”\n",
      "24\n",
      "JZ: One last thing. You were growing up in Italy; were you a member of a Balilla, or\n",
      "one of those Fascist things?\n",
      "AC: We had to wear a black shirt to go to school.\n",
      "JZ: Okay.\n",
      "AC: But I only went to school for three years. The same teacher that taught my mother\n",
      "over there taught all three of our kids.\n",
      "JZ: Really?\n",
      "AC: Yeah.\n",
      "JZ: Taught over in Italy?\n",
      "AC: Over in Italy.\n",
      "JZ: Came here?\n",
      "AC: No, no. My mother went to town one day, to shop at the store. And she seen the\n",
      "teacher. She said, “Hey Giovanna.” My mother’s name was Giovanna. She said,\n",
      "“That boy of yours, he learned nothing, you might as well keep him home.” My\n",
      "mother, I came home, she grabbed a broom she said, “What’s the matter with\n",
      "you? You are supposed to go to school.” So she told me what the teacher told her.\n",
      "I said, “Good.” She said, “Keep him home.” I said, “Good, I’m quitting school\n",
      "then.” That’s the last time I went to school. I only went to third grade over there.\n",
      "So I came over here, and I learned how to read, and write a little bit; I got a little\n",
      "trouble with the spelling. The spelling is tough here, over there the way you\n",
      "pronounce it, is the way you write it.\n",
      "JZ: Right, right.\n",
      "AC: Over here I was telling John, they got so much red tape in between everything.\n",
      "Like Philadelphia, it’s spelled with a P. Over there it would be with an F.\n",
      "Filadelphia. A lot of them are like that, silent.\n",
      "JZ: I just want to say thanks for you service. You raised a wonderful family. You\n",
      "worked hard, compliments to you.\n",
      "25\n",
      "AC: You can ask my neighbor, I raised three good girls.\n",
      "JZ: Anything else you want to say?\n",
      "AC: My youngest daughter, she got two kids. She had a job bartending at a couple\n",
      "different places. She has a big mouth. This last job, the owner and his wife broke\n",
      "up, they got divorced. This disintegrated the business. My daughter told me, Gina,\n",
      "my second daughter, she says, “Terry, her mouth is getting her in trouble, dad.”\n",
      "So I gave her hell this one day. She comes over every Thursday. Changing the\n",
      "bed, washing the clothes, cleaning the bathroom. Every Thursday she brings lunch\n",
      "for me. I said, “What the hell is the matter with you? Can’t you keep that mouth\n",
      "of yours shut?” She said “Dad, you can’t plant corn and get tomatoes. You told\n",
      "me that years ago. You plant corn, you can’t get tomatoes.” [Laughs] That’s the\n",
      "way life is.\n",
      "JZ: Well thank you very much.\n",
      "AC: You’re welcome.\n",
      "JZ: I enjoyed talking with you, and learning so much. Again, thank you for your\n",

      "NC: Cocchiola is an Italian name. Could you tell me a little bit about your Italian\n",
      "ancestry, for instance who was it that first came over from Italy in your family?\n",
      "MC: Yes. Well, my grandfather and my father and his brothers came over from the\n",
      "Naples area of Italy. My mother also came over from the La Campania area east\n",
      "of Naples in Italy. They didn’t know one another but they met here in the United\n",
      "States and they were married later.\n",
      "NC: What was your father’s name and your mother’s name?\n",
      "MC: My father’s name was Carmine Cocchiola. My mother’s name was Angelina\n",
      "Giaquinto. Her name was actually Angela Marie but it evolved into Angelina\n",
      "somehow. That’s what she used, Angelina.\n",
      "NC: Where did the family settle when they came to the United States?\n",
      "MC: They settled in New Jersey, in Nutley, New Jersey.\n",
      "NC: Where is that?\n",
      "MC: That is a few miles east of New York in northern New Jersey and I was born in\n",
      "Nutley, New Jersey. My mother had settled in Raritan, New Jersey which is over\n",
      "by Somerville and Plainfield and Bound Brook, New Jersey. How my mother and\n",
      "father met I don’t know, probably through mutual friends.\n",
      "NC: Raritan, is that close to Nutley? Are they close together?\n",
      "MC: No, they’re about 70 miles apart, I think something like that. Raritan, New Jersey\n",
      "does have a large Italian community.\n",
      "NC: John Basilone was from Raritan or lived in Raritan.\n",
      "1\n",
      "MC: I knew him, I knew John Basilone. I didn’t know him that well. Manila John is\n",
      "what they called him. He won the Medal of Honor at Guadalcanal.\n",
      "NC: Tell me a little bit about Nutley, New Jersey. Was there a big Italian community\n",
      "in Nutley?\n",
      "MC: Well I don’t know how big it was but it’s been very forceful. My cousins have\n",
      "held political office there. Right now the mayor of Nutley, New Jersey is Joanne\n",
      "Cocchiola. She was elected last year. Her father was a member of the council,\n",
      "he’s retired now but he was on the council for a few years. My cousin Carmen\n",
      "Urrechio is on the council, he was mayor three times there. He was also a state\n",
      "senator in New Jersey for about 20 years, then he retired. His brother Frank\n",
      "Urrechio was active and his brother Carl Urrechio was a New Jersey assembly\n",
      "man. Of course they are all gone now except Carmen Urrechio. I saw Carmen\n",
      "Urrechio last year when I visited New Jersey for a funeral.\n",
      "NC: When you were growing up in New Jersey, was the home you grew up in a\n",
      "distinctly Italian home? What kind of examples of the Italian culture took place\n",
      "in your home? Was the language present when you were growing up?\n",
      "MC: Well yes, except my father always used to say to my mother that “You’re an\n",
      "American now, speak English.” But my mother always used to start off a little bit\n",
      "in English but then she switched to Italian but then she switched back to English\n",
      "again. When I would call her on the telephone she would switch back and forth.\n",
      "We always had a little bit of Italian in us. My mother used to like the backyard\n",
      "we had, she grew figs there and tomatoes things like that.\n",
      "NC: Did you have any brothers or sisters?\n",
      "MC: I had an older brother, an older sister, and a younger brother and they’re all gone.\n",
      "I’m the only one left now.\n",
      "NC: Tell me about your early memories. Does anything stand out from growing up in\n",
      "Nutley?\n",
      "MC: Not of Nutley because we moved from Nutley to north New Jersey when I was\n",
      "about four years old, something like that. We lived on Garside Street in north\n",
      "New Jersey for a while. My dad worked at Pittsburgh Plate Glass, so he decided\n",
      "to build a three story house on Grafton Avenue in north Newark, New Jersey;\n",
      "then he could walk to work. It was three stories and he rented out the two and it\n",
      "2\n",
      "was Eliot Street School right across the street so it was very convenient. When I\n",
      "was about five years old or so that’s where I was and I stayed there in that house\n",
      "until World War II came along.\n",
      "NC: Did you attend that school that was across the street?\n",
      "MC: Yes, I graduated from Elliot Street School in 1931.\n",
      "NC: That was an elementary school and then did you go on to another school?\n",
      "MC: I went to Barringer High School. I graduated from Barringer High School in\n",
      "1935.\n",
      "NC: When you were growing up and attending the school, obviously you probably\n",
      "went to school with people whose relatives came from many different parts of the\n",
      "world. Was there any incidence where you were looked down upon because of\n",
      "your Italian heritage or were you accepted as a member of the community and a\n",
      "member of the school?\n",
      "MC: We were accepted in that area. There weren’t any problems because about ten\n",
      "blocks or so to the east there was Verona Avenue and that was where you had a\n",
      "lot of Italians and you had a lot of Italian food stores and all this kind of stuff.\n",
      "Then the Immaculate Conception Roman Catholic Church, they said their mass in\n",
      "Italian. We had an Italian born priest there. So there was plenty of Italian around.\n",
      "NC; Did you want to when you were in school, did you want to be Italian or did you\n",
      "want to be American? Did you think at all about your heritage at that point in\n",
      "your life?\n",
      "MC: No, no it wasn’t that way. Elliot Street School had everything. They had\n",
      "different nationalities, different races and there was never any problem.\n",
      "NC: Tell me if you remember anything about your parents view towards Mussolini,\n",
      "Mussolini’s coming to power in the late ’20s the 1930s. Was there any talk about\n",
      "Mussolini when you were younger, when you were growing up, or were your\n",
      "parents kind of focusing on their life here in the United States and not really Italy?\n",
      "MC: My dad primarily was focused on his life here in the United States. Like he said\n",
      "to my mother, “You’re an American now, speak English.” Fact of the matter is,\n",
      "my mother went back to Italy on two trips but she went alone. My dad didn’t\n",
      "3\n",
      "want to go back particularly but she wanted to go back to see her mother there and\n",
      "that was the only reason. When my grandmother passed away she never went\n",
      "back anymore.\n",
      "NC: Tell me if you remember, and if so what happened, when you found out that Pearl\n",
      "Harbor had been attacked. Do you remember where you were and what you were\n",
      "doing when that announcement came through?\n",
      "MC: I was in the Army at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\n",
      "NC: Oh, you were already in the Army at that point.\n",
      "MC: Yes, I was inducted November 6, 1941 at Fort Dix, New Jersey.\n",
      "NC: A month before Pearl Harbor.\n",
      "MC: Yeah, it was.\n",
      "NC: How did it come about that you entered the military?\n",
      "MC: I was drafted. I had no choice, although I could have gotten a three month\n",
      "deferment from Pittsburgh Plate Glass. The treasury said to me, “Mike I can get\n",
      "you a 90 day deferment.” I said to him I might as well go and get it over with.\n",
      "Why wait around for 90 days? All I would be doing is having going away parties.\n",
      "So I went November 6 to Fort Dix, New Jersey.\n",
      "NC: What was your feeling when you found you had been drafted? Were you scared,\n",
      "were you proud, were you nervous?\n",
      "MC: No, I was more or less indifferent to it, you see. September 1940, my older\n",
      "brother Frank volunteered for the one-year service. He and three buddies, they\n",
      "got a lot of publicity in the paper. They signed up for one-year, so he served one\n",
      "year with the 1st Infantry Division from September 1940 to September 1941 and\n",
      "then they discharged them, but that didn’t do them any good because in 1942 he\n",
      "had to go back in again. The one-year service didn’t get him anything. That one-\n",
      "year voluntary service was supposed to take care of your draft obligation but it\n",
      "didn’t work out that way.\n",
      "NC: When you were drafted and reported to Fort Dix, New Jersey did you at that point\n",
      "have any idea about the scale of the conflict and America’s involvement in the\n",
      "4\n",
      "conflict? Did you know that this world war was going to happen and that you\n",
      "were going to be in the middle?\n",
      "MC: Oh yes, I felt that sooner or later. I had been following Franklin Roosevelt’s\n",
      "Lend-Lease Program and so forth and I knew that it was just a matter of time.\n",
      "Funny thing about that, I might relate this, on November 6, I went in Fort Dix,\n",
      "on November 7 after they gave me my uniform and so forth, I was being\n",
      "interviewed the next day. I’m sitting there in the interview room, I remember it\n",
      "was a Friday; I was inducted on a Thursday. Friday November 7 I am sitting\n",
      "there waiting my turn to be interviewed and that was supposed to be to classify\n",
      "you in a particular branch of service or whatever. This was the Army but whether\n",
      "it was going to be artillery, infantry, finance, or what. So I am sitting there and\n",
      "this fellow comes walking by, I look up, I said “Pete!” It was Pete Cummings\n",
      "who lived a block away from me, I used to go to his house. My brother used to\n",
      "go over there and play poker. Pete Cummings was a beefy guy, big beefy guy.\n",
      "He was a corporal. He says, “Sergeant I’ll take this man next.” So I figured, oh\n",
      "boy now I’m going to get myself a choice assignment, right. So he takes me in,\n",

      "Hitler was the brains behind the whole thing and that Mussolini just went along\n",
      "with it. Italians were not in favor of Mussolini going to war, so we never\n",
      "experienced any problems. This group that I was inducted with there were quite a\n",
      "few Italians because they come from north New Jersey and they came from Jersey\n",

      "kind of intermingle with all the other people of non-Italians?\n",
      "MC: Well, when they put us in the barracks you did it alphabetically. So I was in the\n",
      "first barracks, my surname began with a C. One fellow Marty Burn, he and I\n",
      "became good friends. He was from Newark, New Jersey. He was downstairs and\n",
      "I was upstairs, just got to know one another. He was Irish, I was Italian but we\n",
      "got along great for 50 years or so. It was just who you were with; nobody even\n",

      "NC: How did the officers treat you?\n",
      "MC: Well, you see in the barracks you had on each floor you had a corporal and a\n",
      "sergeant. They had their own room at the end of the floor. I remember the\n",
      "sergeant’s name was Moody, his last name, and the corporal’s name was Offit and\n",
      "we used to call him the Offit Corporal. So that’s how you were told what to do.\n",
      "They’d been around. They were most of them in the regular Army and they told\n",
      "us what to do and we did it.\n",
      "NC: Give me an example of some of your training after you were recruited and went to\n",
      "Fort Bragg. What type of things did you do?\n",
      "6\n",
      "MC: We were on the 155 mm “Long Tom” cannon that was an old WWI French type\n",
      "artillery weapon. We were cannoniers. You work on the gun and clean it up,\n",
      "load it up, whatever you had to do. It was an obsolete weapon, this was only for\n",

      "next week we were in right after reveille they said anybody who has a driver’s\n",
      "license take one step forward. So I took on step forward, I figured hey maybe I’m\n",
      "gonna get a jeep or something. So they marched us down to the battalion motor\n",
      "pool and help change the oil on the trucks that’s what we did. I said to myself I\n",
      "gotta be careful what I volunteer for around here. But it worked out though, I\n",
      "remember one time I had a jeep assignment that day from message center, you\n",
      "know delivery stuff and what have you, and it was a drizzling day. It was late\n",
      "November I guess. I come back at lunch time; I went and got my mess kit. I\n",
      "started to walk up to the mess hall. I get up close to the mess hall and I see these\n",
      "guys all standing outside. I said “What’s going on?” You know I just finished\n",
      "my work in the morning and I was coming back from my lunch. They said\n",
      "“We’re not going to eat today.” I said, “Why not?” “We’re on strike.” I said,\n",
      "“You’re on strike?” I figured, what are they on strike for? I want my lunch. They\n",
      "had a session with the mess sergeant, he was a regular Army guy from Tennessee,\n",
      "he was a staff sergeant. Somebody said something in the starter and he said\n",
      "“Everybody outside, nobody lining up in the mess hall.” So they retaliated and\n",
      "they said “We’re not going to eat your food.” There was no lunch for anybody\n",
      "that day. So that afternoon around 3:30 or so we were all told to go to the\n",
      "auditorium. So we all went to the auditorium and there was this full colonel up\n",
      "there, southern colonel and he said to us, “I could have all you men court-\n",
      "marshaled for disobeying orders and so forth.” I’m sitting there and I’ve had no\n",
      "lunch, nothing and he’s gonna threaten us with court-marshal. We are making\n",
      "$21 a month and you take out $.25 for the battery fund and you take out $6 for\n",
      "laundry. What do we wind up with, less than $15, how worse can you get? He\n",

      "7\n",
      "guys are street smart from New York City, Jersey City, Newark, New Jersey and\n",
      "that area. They don’t take anything from anybody and they know how to retaliate\n",
      "and that’s what they did that day. They wouldn’t take any guff from anybody.\n",
      "That’s why they told that mess sergeant where to get off at. I understand that later\n",
      "on he was transferred.\n",
      "NC: Did you have any difficulty converting yourself to military life, the daily\n",
      "regimens, the workouts, and the training?\n",
      "MC: No, I was single and that helps. You don’t have to dwell on what’s happening at\n",
      "home and all that kind of stuff. It worked out pretty well.\n",
      "NC: You were at Fort Bragg when you heard about Pearl Harbor?\n",
      "MC: Yes, that was the Sunday I guess it was with the time difference there. I know\n",
      "Moody and Offit were running around. They ran to supply and got rifles and so\n",
      "forth. They were ready for anything I guess. Of course we weren’t allowed to\n",
      "have anything but everybody was on alert that day.\n",
      "NC: Did you notice a mood change amongst the men from before Pearl Harbor and\n",
      "after Pearl Harbor? Did they become more serious in the training that you were\n",
      "doing? Was there more of a concern?\n",
      "MC: No, there wasn’t that much of a change. Actually, I think that most of these guys\n",
      "were single, most of them at that time. It didn’t mean that much to them,\n",
      "everybody wanted to finish their training and go someplace else, that was the\n",
      "attitude. They were wondering where they’re gonna go because some of them\n",
      "probably wouldn’t stay in the artillery. I know one guy; he was a bookish sort of\n",
      "individual. He wound up in Indiana in finance division, he was a stock broker.\n",
      "NC: What about your training specifically? You spent those 13 weeks at Fort Bragg,\n",
      "what happened after that?\n",
      "MC: Well, about a couple of weeks were finished there we got word that we were\n",
      "going up to Sackets Harbor on Lake Ontario and join a National Guard outfit as\n",
      "replacements, but there was about 20 or 25 of us and I was one of them and they\n",
      "said “No you’re not going. You’re going down to Camp Claiborne, Louisiana\n",

      "up to Sackets Harbor, luckily. I was back with my group again, so that was fine, I\n",
      "didn’t have to make new friends. That’s where we stayed for a while and that was\n",
      "up near Watertown, New York. It was the 258th Field Artillery Regiment. We\n",
      "did pretty good. We had marches and every time, of course we were younger and\n",
      "stronger, that we beat the old National Guard. Those guys were older but they\n",
      "had all the ratings. I was put in the headquarters as a fire direction control guy.\n",
      "The guy who had that job he was a staff sergeant, he didn’t do that job. I was a\n",
      "private and I was doing the job because they maintained their ratings. That was\n",
      "the only bad feature of it.\n",
      "NC: Tell me what the fire direction control person would actually do. What was their\n",
      "role?\n",
      "MC: It would be in the Fire Direction Control Center in the command post and he\n",
      "would give out the commands. Left so much and right so much and give the\n",
      "direction of the fire for the equipment, whatever it might be whatever the cannons\n",
      "would be. That’s what a fire direction control guy would do. He would measure\n",
      "on a map exactly where the target and what you need to get the weapon to put a\n",
      "projectile onto the target.\n",
      "NC: How did you come to be the one selected for that? It sounds like that is a more\n",
      "technical job; it takes a little more intelligence perhaps. It takes a little more\n",
      "experience. Did you have some pre-war experience in that area?\n",
      "MC: No, see I was an accountant and I’d gone to college for a couple of years during\n",
      "the evening while I was working at PPG. So I was good at figures and so forth\n",
      "and that’s what you have to do. So I was in the 258th Field Artillery Regiment\n",
      "and then they broke it up and then made up the other battalion and the 258th\n",
      "became the 991st Field Artillery Battalion and they started to bring the younger\n",
      "guys into it. Eventually I went to Officer’s Candidate School after they shifted me\n",
      "to the 186th Field Artillery; they broke up the 258th as a regiment and made\n",
      "battalions out of it. I went to 186th Field Artillery Battalion and fire direction\n",
      "control. I got along real well there, in a matter of several months they told ‘em\n",
      "that I was okay for Officer Candidate School at Fort Sill, Oklahoma and that’s\n",
      "where I went.\n",
      "NC: So after New York you went out to Fort Sill?\n",
      "9\n",
      "MC: Fort Sill, Oklahoma for officer training and I became a 2nd Lieutenant January\n",
      "21st, 1943. It was a kind of odd coincidence on that I was good at fire direction\n",
      "and the fellow I had met as a master sergeant in the 258th Field Artillery in\n",
      "headquarters, he was out there as a 2nd lieutenant on teaching tactics and of course\n",
      "I was in his class. It was a big class. So one evening there was a knock on the\n",
      "door in our hut. There was six of us in the hut, that’s how they operated out in\n",
      "Fort Sill. It was John Rice, 2nd Lt. John Rice. Everybody snapped to attention.\n",
      "We acted like privates, some had better ratings. He asked me to come outside and\n",
      "he asked me if I’d like to stay there in Fort Sill, Oklahoma as a gunnery instructor.\n",
      "I says “Oh no John, thanks but no thanks.” He meant well but that wasn’t for me.\n",
      "NC: Did you, during all of your training at both Basic and OCS, did you receive\n",
      "training in small arms weapons? What kind of weapons were you trained with?\n",
      "MC: Oh yeah. We had the carbine. I was an expert on the carbine and a sharpshooter\n",
      "on .45 caliber handgun.\n",
      "NC: Did you have any pre-war experience with guns?\n",
      "MC: No.\n",
      "NC: Tell me about after you graduated from Officer’s Candidate School. What\n",
      "happened next?\n",
      "MC: We had a choice. They gave you a choice of three places you could go to. One\n",
      "was tank destroyer outfit in Camp Howze, Texas. There was Fort Bragg, North\n",
      "Carolina.\n",
      "NC: Was that a tank destroyer outfit too?\n",
      "MC: No. I’m trying to think of the third one, but I can’t seem to think what the choice\n",
      "was. It escapes me, but anyways, I chose Fort Bragg because that was in the\n",
      "eastern part of the United States and I figured I could get home a little easier from\n",
      "there. So I went to Fort Bragg. Then we made another choice, there I went to the\n",
      "11th Airborne Division. Glider field artillery, that was a brand new outfit, brand\n",
      "new division. The only thing wrong with it was I surprised at all the men that\n",
      "came in didn’t have any training. We had to give them basic training and I wasn’t\n",
      "happy with that. Usually, you get your basic training somewhere and then you go\n",
      "to a division, but here they didn’t do that. So I had to give them basic training, of\n",
      "course, it put me in good shape. I was really running around and all that kind of\n",
      "10\n",
      "stuff. Now this was the glider field artillery and of course you had the\n",
      "paratroopers for the infantry right along side of us. Eventually, I had to get out of\n",
      "that outfit because the atmosphere wasn’t good with my group, my battery\n",
      "commander. He was from Baltimore and he got into a discussion with one of my\n",
      "friends there, he was reconnaissance officer Bob Barry. Poor Bob he lost his eye\n",
      "in an accident, they were working on some bombs in a rehearsal bid-whack area.\n",
      "Any rate I sided with Bob one night when we were out drinking with the general’s\n",
      "daughter there. They had a dance and I’m dancing. I shifted over to the 795th\n",
      "Field Artillery Battalion at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. I was glad to get out of\n",
      "there. I always tried to get something that I like to do, wanted to do. Over at the\n",
      "795th I was there a while and I met my buddy Andy Cortize, Angelo Cortize from\n",
      "New Jersey. I’d met him out at Fort Sill at OCS and he was the executive officer\n",
      "of the battery and we threw a reunion more or less. We used to go home on\n",
      "weekends. I had my brother’s car and we’d go home. We’d get some choice\n",
      "bottles of liquor from Andy’s father at the tavern and bring them back. We’d give\n",
      "them out to those we liked and those who we didn’t care much, we gave the lesser\n",
      "brands.\n",
      "NC: Were you back in New Jersey at the time you were with the 795th?\n",
      "MC: Still Fort Bragg. So one day at lunch time I was sitting there and this lieutenant\n",
      "opposite me was saying goodbye to some of the others. I didn’t know him at all, I\n",
      "had seen him around. I said “Where are you going?” He said “I’m going to the\n",
      "Air Force.” “You are? How are you doing that?” He said “They want officers as\n",
      "well as enlisted men for aircrew training.” “How do you get that?” Now you\n",
      "have to understand that this happened within, I mean if I hadn’t been there that\n",
      "day at that time and watched them saying goodbye to this guy I would have never\n",
      "known about this. So he says, “All you have to do, Mike, is get an application\n",
      "and get a physical over at Pope AFB, (which was right at Fort Bragg) and send it\n",
      "directly to Captain Brown in Washington, DC.” “Oh is that it?” He said “Yeah.”\n",
      "So Andy Cortize and I decided to do that. So I went first and I got my physical\n",
      "and Andy didn’t pass, I guess he had been out drinking too much beer. He had to\n",
      "go the next day for another physical. In the mean time I took my application and\n",
      "my physical was okay and I went into to see the colonel who nobody ever did\n",
      "like. I can’t remember his name. He was from Fort Sill. He was an instructor out\n",
      "there. He’d never had any combat, but he knew his paperwork, that’s about all I\n",
      "can say for him. So I went into see the colonel and I told him what I wanted to\n",
      "do. He said, “Lieutenant, do you realize that the Army has spent over $5,000 to\n",
      "train you as a field artillery officer?” I said, “Yes, I understand that colonel, but\n",
      "all you have to do if you don’t approve of this is say, not approved.” There was a\n",
      "11\n",
      "spot on the paper that said approve or disapprove. So he disapproved it and I said\n",
      "“You can send that directly to Washington DC to Capt. Brown.” He said “No,\n",
      "I’m not going to do that, I am going to send it up the chain-of-command up to\n",
      "Brigade and then it will take care of itself.” So I had to salute and leave. The first\n",
      "thing I did was go out and see the master sergeant. I told him my problem. I said\n",
      "“There’s a paper coming out going up the brigade. My name’s on it and that\n",
      "really should go to Washington, DC.” Now I was taking a chance here. I come\n",
      "out later that day; the master sergeant didn’t do it. The paper went up. I went up\n",
      "the brigade and I saw this 2nd lieutenant there and I told him my problem about\n",
      "this paperwork should be going to Washington DC. He reached down and the\n",
      "bottom drawer of his desk and he pulls out my paperwork, the blue paper. Oh I\n",
      "said to myself, this is going to 3rd Army in Tennessee that’s the headquarters and\n",
      "it’ll never get there. So I said to the lieutenant, “There’s been an error here; that\n",
      "really should be going to Washington DC.” He said, “Oh, I don’t really know\n",
      "about it.” He marks it CO-commanding officer 795th Field Artillery Battalion and\n",
      "he sends it back. That’s when I went over and I saw the corporal at the message\n",
      "center. I said “There’s a piece of paper with my name CO 795th it’s name on it,\n",
      "get it and put it in my pigeon hole, okay?” He said “Okay, if I see it I’ll do it.”\n",
      "So that afternoon around 5 o’clock I go over and there it is in my pigeon hole. I\n",
      "put it in the envelope and I mail it to Washington. In the meantime, Andy Cortize\n",
      "he’s having conniptions because he’s saying, “Oh, you’re going to get court-\n",
      "marshaled!” He goes in to see the colonel and he said “I’m not signing any\n",
      "transfers, period,” because Andy was the executive officer of the battery. He\n",
      "wouldn’t even disapprove it, he wouldn’t sign it. He stayed there. About three\n",
      "weeks later the colonel calls me into his office. He said, “Lieutenant, I can’t\n",
      "understand this.” “What’s that Colonel?” “I’ve got orders for you to report to San\n",
      "Antonio, Texas for aircrew training.” “Is that so Colonel?” “Yes, you got 10\n",
      "delay en route.” Everybody was astonished. I probably would have been court-\n",
      "marshaled if I had been caught, but it worked out. I got ten days, I went home to\n",
      "Newark, New Jersey and for that weekend my mother comes into my bedroom\n",
      "and said “There’s somebody outside to see you.” There was three guys from Fort\n",
      "Bragg; they drove up to see me off.\n",
      "NC: What was it about joining an aircrew that interested you so much that you would\n",
      "go through all of this trouble? Did you have a desire just to get out of the artillery\n",
      "or was there something about planes and the air corps that was interesting?\n",
      "MC: I thought about pilot training for a while there, but then it was just that I didn’t\n",
      "feel right in that outfit particularly. I thought I’d get some training and see where\n",
      "I could go, maybe a navigator. A navigator seemed to be a good choice too.\n",
      "12\n",
      "NC: Had you been in a plane before?\n",
      "MC: Yeah, I had been flying commercially before that in my job and so forth. The\n",
      "only problem here was that my orders, it said I’d go to San Antonio, Texas for\n",
      "aircrew training, in the event that I did not pass the physical, I report back to my\n",
      "old outfit. There was no way. I was going to take anything, whether it was pilot,\n",
      "bombardier, navigator, anything that they accept me for so that I wouldn’t have to\n",
      "go back and face the colonel again, you know. Because you know what that\n",
      "would be. So it worked out that I took bombardier/navigator.\n",
      "NC: You thought you had the option of choosing whichever one you wanted?\n",
      "MC: Yes, whatever you could pass the physical for. On depth perception, I was a little\n",
      "bit shaky on that and that’s imperative for a pilot.\n",
      "NC: I assume some of the experience you got reading map coordinates for the artillery\n",
      "helps you out being a bombardier/navigator.\n",
      "MC: Oh sure. Yeah, yeah. That’s helpful knowledge of maps and things like that.\n",
      "Then I went through the aircrew training. The other reason I didn’t go for pilot\n",
      "was because pilot takes too long. It would have taken an awful long time and I\n",
      "was anxious to get overseas a little bit, you know. I knew I could go through\n",
      "bombardier training, no problem with that.\n",
      "NC: Tell me a little bit about the training for the…\n",
      "[End Tape 1, Side A]\n",
      "[Begin Tape 2, Side B]\n",
      "MC: I went to, well it was in Texas, Ellington Field for several weeks and Childress\n",
      "AFB up near Amarillo and that was sort of the balance of that training. Dropping\n",
      "bombs, practice bombs and things like that and you’d get dead reckoning\n",

      "MC: Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Six. Radio operator and five gunners, tail gunner, two waist\n",
      "gunners, nose gunner.\n",
      "NC: Tell me a little bit about the planes that you flew. What was the name of the\n",
      "plane that you flew? Type of plane that you flew?\n",
      "MC: Eventually you mean, not the training. The training were the smaller ones just\n",
      "strictly for bombing. B-24 Liberator, they made more B-24 Liberators than any\n",
      "other bomber in WWII. They used them both in the South Pacific and out of\n",
      "England, out of Italy, out of Northern Africa, but the B-17 Flying Fortress got a\n",
      "lot of publicity. We always used to say the B-17 had a public relations guy on\n",
      "each plane.\n",
      "NC: Yeah, a lot of people remember the Memphis Belle. So the guys that you met and\n",
      "were crewed up with at Omaha, those were the guys that you would fly with when\n",
      "you went overseas or some of them were?\n",
      "MC: Yes, the only problem with that was after a while I was over there I flew about\n",
      "four or five missions with them; they took me off the crew and put me on what I\n",
      "call “The Flying Misfits.” These were guys who for one reason or another they\n",
      "were sick, maybe they needed a couple of missions to finish their 35 or 30 if you\n",
      "were lead crew. John Corby was a co-pilot; he became ill so he didn’t finish up\n",
      "with his crew so he was pilot. I was the navigator, bombardier/navigator. Others\n",
      "who needed a few missions to finish out their 35 were put on there. I had no\n",
      "choice really. They promoted me to First Lieutenant after I had a few missions;\n",
      "then one day, this is kind of ironic, I see this guy all the time, now I am going to\n",
      "see him again when we go down to Savannah, Andy Andreessen from California.\n",
      "He said he slept a couple of beds away from me. He came in with his crew. He\n",
      "said, “Mike, you are flying with the colonel tomorrow.” I says, “What?” This is\n",
      "Lt. Col. Heber Thompson; he was our squadron commander, 713th Squadron. He\n",
      "said, “Yeah, he’s coming back. He finished up his 30 missions as lead crew and\n",
      "he went home for leave. Now he’s come back and he wants to fly an element\n",
      "lead, just for practice to get the hands on. Captain will be the co-pilot.” Captain\n",
      "was down at the other end of my hut and he was a guy who didn’t get along with\n",
      "his crew, of course I didn’t know this until later. They moved him into our hut.\n",
      "He was the co-pilot, I was the bombardier/navigator, Heber Thompson one of the\n",
      "best pilots ever he was squadron commander, he was only 27, he was the pilot,\n",
      "14\n",
      "and of course we got all these guys. Some I knew, some I didn’t know, I\n",
      "wouldn’t know who was gonna show up to be the gunner or whatever, the nose\n",
      "gunner I wouldn’t know. We went that day. We went to Hamburg to bomb. I’ll\n",
      "never forget that. We were on the bomb run; we hit the IP, the initial point, and\n",
      "all of the sudden fog. Nothing. I looked out the blister and I couldn’t see\n",
      "anybody. We were in element lead; we were in front anyway on the high right. I\n",
      "look out, nobody, there was just fog. I had the bomb bay doors open and I’m\n",
      "waiting. There’s nothing to do. Finally, the pilot, the colonel says “Close the\n",
      "bomb bay doors.” I guess he told the others, because I couldn’t hear; I’m down in\n",
      "the nose, to put the pins back in the bombs. I didn’t know what he did because I\n",
      "thought maybe he might want to drop them anywhere, somewhere. We were over\n",
      "Hamburg and you go up to the North Sea, it wasn’t very far and then you get into\n",
      "the English Channel. He says, “Give me a heading home.” So I give him a\n",
      "heading that was 3-10, I think it was. Okay, we started out and still we couldn’t\n",
      "see anything. I don’t like fog, I didn’t see one other plane and we’re up at 30,000\n",
      "feet or whatever it was. We go out and we’re going up and luckily, just going\n",
      "over the German coast there, a squadron or maybe it was a group of B-24s came\n",
      "by. You could tell by the tail markings that it was part of our combat wing. We\n",
      "had about five groups in the wing. I hear him say, “Pilot, navigator, I am going to\n",
      "tag onto this group.” I said, “Okay,” I said, “Roger.” I was so happy because we\n",
      "could see. So he tags on and I thought what about the bombs? Isn’t he gonna\n",
      "drop them? You know, he’s a lieutenant colonel, maybe he doesn’t want to drop\n",
      "bombs anywhere. I said we’re gonna take these back with us? I wasn’t happy\n",
      "about that. So he tags on and he goes on a while, we’re over the English Channel\n",
      "you can drop bombs there. Not a word then he says, “Breakaway, give me a\n",
      "heading home.” So I give him a 270 heading or something like that we went\n",
      "home. I never discussed it with him; after all he’s a colonel. We took the bombs\n",
      "back. I’ll never get over, that’s the only time. I guess he felt oh you can’t drop\n",
      "bombs, wasted or hurt somebody I don’t know. You’re the only one I ever told\n",
      "that story.\n",
      "NC: I guess you never found out why he didn’t.\n",
      "MC: I never asked. What am I gonna ask him for? He’ll say “It’s none of your\n",
      "business.”\n",
      "NC: Let’s go back to when you were first deployed overseas. What unit were you\n",
      "assigned to at that point? Did you have a particular squadron that you were\n",
      "associated with at the point? Do you remember?\n",
      "15\n",
      "MC: Yeah. We flew over.\n",
      "NC: You didn’t fly your own planes over though, did you?\n",
      "MC: We brought the new ones over, it’s what you do. You go to Wichita, Kansas and\n",
      "you get a brand new airplane and that’s the way of bringing the new airplanes\n",
      "over. On our whole crew got in there and we stopped up in New Hampshire to\n",
      "refuel and so forth. We flew to Gus Bay, Labrador, then we flew to Iceland\n",
      "overnight there, then we flew over to Wales and we got rid of the plane. And then\n",
      "we went up to the Belfast area and then we were assigned to England, Seething\n",
      "AFB 448th Bomb Group. I was in the 713th Squadron.\n",
      "NC: Were you and the men of your crew happy that you were going to Europe as\n",
      "opposed to the Pacific Theater or did you not have any feelings one way or\n",
      "another?\n",
      "MC: No, I think we were all were happy we were going to someplace where they’re\n",
      "English speaking; that’s an advantage and better living I guess.\n",
      "NC: On your first crew was there one particular guy that you became very close to or\n",
      "did you not have any really good, close, personal relationships with anyone?\n",
      "MC: Old Hyde. His name is L.R. Hyde. I call him “Little Raw Hyde.” Lewis, he\n",
      "called me last week and Ben Johnson. Ben Johnson was a nose gunner but he’s\n",
      "got Parkinson’s now.\n",
      "NC: What was Hyde’s role on the plane?\n",
      "MC: He was a navigator on the first crew I was with, and then he and I were in the\n",
      "same hut. We were fellow navigators really. So I was checked out as a navigator\n",
      "and I got a certificate and all that kind of stuff. So, we stayed in the same hut\n",
      "even though I wasn’t flying with them anymore. I was alone with the Misfits.\n",
      "NC: Where did you fly your first mission? Do you remember?\n",
      "MC: Yeah, I got them all listed. They all went to Germany.\n",
      "NC: When would it have been? Do you know approximately? And I guess it probably\n",
      "would have been some time in ’43.\n",
      "16\n",
      "MC: No, ’44. One day I sat down, see this book, John Rowe, he was a pilot, this was\n",
      "his crew and he gave me this book. Those are his missions and then I put mine\n",
      "down. The first one was back here September the 12th to Germany. They all\n",
      "were Germany after that.\n",
      "NC: What were your feelings on your first mission? Were you scared, excited,\n",
      "nervous?\n",
      "MC: No, I’m not that type of guy really. My first mission we went to Eastern\n",
      "Germany, it was a small target. And I noticed on our right this plane was going\n",
      "along, all of the sudden you could see the flak where the artillery 88s hitting. It\n",
      "went bomb, bomb, bomb, bing! And the guy went down, hit his wing, but he\n",
      "pulled out of it way down. So I watched them and lost sight of them that’s the\n",
      "way it was.\n",
      "NC: This was another B-24?\n",
      "MC: Oh yeah, they were all B-24s.\n",
      "NC: What did the flak look like?\n",
      "MC: It’s like a puff of smoke. It just billows and then you go through this and you\n",
      "look back and say did I go through that? It rattles against the plane just hope it\n",
      "doesn’t get a direct hit. You’re always going to get some peripheral damage,\n",
      "splatters. Hopefully, it just doesn’t hit an engine.\n",
      "NC: Did you fly out with fighter escorts at this point or had the Allies achieved air\n",
      "superiority that they didn’t need to at this point?\n",
      "MC: Yes, we had that. That was one of the best things that had ever happened. We go\n",
      "over and fighter escorts coming from France would meet us well before the target\n",
      "and that was a big advantage. We were lucky. Depends on your place in the\n",
      "whole bombing run, I mean the German fighters would come out, if they catch\n",
      "you in the beginning the guys in the back are going to escape it because they’re all\n",
      "tied up with somebody and the P-47 Thunderbolts and the P-51. If you were\n",
      "unlucky and you happen to be there when the German fighters happened to\n",
      "decided to come out and fight, well then you were in the middle of it.\n",
      "NC: Were you ever on board or on a mission when you were attacked by German\n",
      "fighters?\n",
      "17\n",
      "MC: No. Generally, they’d stay their distance if they saw the P-47s and the P-51s. We\n",
      "were lucky. When I saw them in the latter part of the war when they had the jets\n",
      "but they weren’t that good at flying jets yet, so they had those ME-262s out there\n",
      "somewhere. They were experimenting with them. Hitler made a big mistake that\n",
      "he didn’t get those jets before he did get them. He would have been much better\n",
      "off but he didn’t have them. I read an article once that said he thought that he\n",
      "didn’t need them particularly, but during it he fell flat on his face because he\n",
      "didn’t have the fighter support that he needed. The P-51s just took over.\n",
      "NC: The waist-gunners and the gunners on your particular planes didn’t fire their\n",
      "weapons too often.\n",
      "MC: Not too often, no, we were lucky.\n",
      "NC: Tell me a little bit about your responsibilities on a particular mission. You would\n",
      "be the one in charge of charting the course of the plane?\n",
      "MC: Well, what they did was they gave you a map of the particular part of Europe,\n",
      "Germany and so forth and they outline on it and they sketch exactly the route.\n",
      "Also, on occasion they give you flak points where the German 88s might be. The\n",
      "lead navigator would chart it out and you would follow along. You’d follow\n",
      "along and you always knew where you were based on the lead navigator. If he\n",
      "was on course, you’d be on course; usually they were because you would know it.\n",
      "If he’s off course, you would know that, but they did a good job of that.\n",
      "NC: Were you ever the lead navigator?\n",
      "MC: No, of the misfits. The only time, one time I was flying an element lead and the\n",
      "lead ship the northern bomb side went out of whack. It was on an operative and\n",
      "they asked me. I got down and I was gonna start bombing for the group but it was\n",
      "overcast. You couldn’t see a thing so they dropped it by radar, dropped the\n",
      "bombs by radar.\n",
      "NC: What was the northern bomb site was that new? Was that a new technology at the\n",
      "time?\n",
      "MC: Yeah, it’s about this big. In fact, a buddy of mine had one. He died a couple of\n",
      "years ago, but he got one. I was wondering what his widow is going to do with it.\n",
      "It’s about two feet wide and about a foot and a half high. What you do is\n",
      "18\n",
      "synchronize it and when the two guidelines meet that’s when your bombs drop.\n",
      "So what you do is focus on it and try to get the hairs on the target.\n",
      "NC: And that was located in the nose of the B-24.\n",
      "MC: The nose, on the floor.\n",
      "NC: So when you were traveling is that where you spent your time or only when you\n",
      "were ready to bomb you would go there?\n",
      "MC: Only when I was ready to bomb. When we hit the bomb run, what they call the\n",
      "initial point that’s when you get down and you’re rotating the knobs trying to get\n",
      "the thing and synchronization.\n",
      "NC: Did you have a name for the planes that you flew? Did the men name the planes?\n",
      "MC: Well, ours was Old Pop 75\n",
      "NC: Was this with the sphincter or was this the original one?\n",
      "MC: Here it is Old 75.\n",
      "NC: Oh it had a picture of an old man.\n",
      "MC: Yeah one old guy but that was my idea or our idea, we inherited this plane.\n",
      "NC: So that was on there all ready?\n",
      "MC: Yeah, we came later so we weren’t around to initially put all the good stuff on the\n",
      "nose, all the ladies and so forth, pin up girls Betty Grable and the rest of them.\n",
      "NC: Did you have any idea what the 75 was?\n",
      "MC: 75 missions that plane had flown up to that point.\n",
      "NC: Was that the plane that you flew with the misfits?\n",
      "MC: Yeah, most of the time with John Corbit, he was from Harrisburg, I didn’t know\n",
      "him before.\n",
      "19\n",
      "NC: What kinds of equipment were you issued with the expectation or possibility of\n",
      "you being shot down? Did you have an escape kit or did you have sidearms or\n",
      "anything like that?\n",
      "MC: I was just gonna tell you. We used to carry a .45 gun but then they decided that\n",
      "we turn those in, which I did to the supply section because when a guy went down\n",
      "in Germany with a .45 likely he would be killed. He would probably grab the .45\n",
      "and the Germans would see he had a .45 and they would shoot him down right on\n",
      "the ground. They stopped that immediately when they had a few incidents like\n",
      "that because the Germans used to take farm implements. Brooms, whatever they’d\n",
      "whack you. I know my old roommate Mickey Schliker, he was shot down in\n",
      "February 1945 and his name Schliker-German he got a few whacks but at least\n",
      "they didn’t bother him. If you were Jewish you were in trouble so you tried not to\n",
      "emphasize that.\n",
      "NC: How many missions did a traditional team or group fly?\n",
      "MC: 35 for a crew. If you were a lead ship, 30.\n",
      "NC: Were any of your missions particularly dangerous or difficult that stand out in\n",
      "your mind, where there was a lot of flak or a lot of enemy resistance?\n",
      "MC: When you went to Hamburg or you went to the Ruhr Valley you got a lot of flak.\n",
      "I went to Magdeburg three times, Hamburg three times and you get a lot of flak\n",
      "when you are above the oil refineries. Hamburg had the oil refineries. Magdeburg\n",
      "had a lot of rail yards, marshaling yards I used to call them, where all the freight\n",
      "came together. Of course the idea was to bomb them and they stop the supplies,\n",
      "oil, and everything else from going through and that’s what hurt the Germans near\n",
      "the end of the war because they didn’t get the supplies they needed. The\n",
      "Americans controlled the air and that hurt them very very badly.\n",
      "NC: Were there any type of rivalries in the Army Air Corps related to what type of\n",
      "plane you would fly, for instance the B-25 guys, the B-24 guys, the B-17 guys.\n",
      "MC: There was an intense rivalry between the B-17 Flying Fortress and the B-24\n",
      "Liberties and there is to this day.\n",
      "NC: And you think the B-24 is more important?\n",
      "20\n",
      "MC: Well naturally I am a B-24 Liberator guy. The B-17s like the Memphis Belle they\n",
      "got all the publicity, but they made more B-24s than they did B-17s that we know.\n",
      "Because they carried a heavier bomb load, they could higher and they could fly\n",
      "farther. They were a better airplane but they used to call them ‘flying boxcars’\n",
      "‘flying coffins’ but the B-17 looked a little more majestic. They had more fleet,\n",
      "more a shine to them. I don’t know, I suppose.\n",
      "NC: What kind of uniform did you wear when you were flying? Did you have like a\n",
      "bomber jacket?\n",
      "MC: No we had this electric flying suit that’s electric, you plug it in and I carried it,\n",
      "then this jacket over it.\n",
      "NC: What was the point of the flying suit? I would keep the temperature?\n",
      "MC: Well you plug it in. Electric heat, it’s heated. Trying to see if you can see it on\n",
      "here. Had the boots on too.\n",
      "NC: Who had the highest rank in your plane? You were a first lieutenant at the time.\n",
      "MC: First lieutenant was about a captain for a pilot and first lieutenant for the co-pilot,\n",
      "navigator, bombardier, generally. And then you had a staff sergeant for the radio\n",
      "operator and flight engineer and sergeants for the gunners or staff sergeants\n",
      "sometimes.\n",
      "NC: What was the feeling like when you first returned from a mission and safely\n",
      "landed in the airfield? Was it a feeling of relief and satisfaction and pride, or did\n",
      "it just become routine for you?\n",
      "MC: It became routine, sort of, and of course when you came down you get debriefing.\n",
      "They go and interrogate you and ask you about what you saw. Of course, I as the\n",
      "navigator would record. For example, one day I see a plane maybe at 7 o’clock\n",
      "high. I count 4 parachutes and I say to the guys if I can’t see count the parachutes\n",
      "because I have the location and what time. And then what they do is my report\n",
      "plus other planes coming in verify exactly what happened.\n",
      "NC: How many missions did you wind up flying in WWII?\n",
      "MC: 35.\n",
      "21\n",
      "NC: And then what happens, do you remember the final missions? Does that stand out\n",
      "in your mind because it was such an important one, that 35th mission?\n",
      "MC: No, not really it was kind of hectic. This was right after the Battle of the Bulge\n",
      "and we were flying. I flew Christmas Day, December 25, 1944 and then the next\n",
      "day. The Battle of the Bulge started December 16, 1944 and I didn’t fly; went\n",
      "down everyday at about 3 o’clock in the morning something like that, waited. No\n",
      "mission and then we’d go back. Finally December 24th I flew, I remember I was\n",
      "just anxious to get them over with because those guys needed some help. I got a\n",
      "letter from Belgium from my friend Ed Shay. Ed had gone to OCS but he didn’t\n",
      "make it. He went back and he became a medic and he was in Belgium. He sent\n",
      "me a letter that made feel good that day when I got that letter. He said we came\n",
      "out we saw all those planes, oh they were cheering.\n",
      "NC: They needed any morale building thing that they could find.\n",
      "MC: They were stuck for a couple of weeks in there, I guess it was. Now I remember\n",
      "the third choice, I should have remembered it, the 106th Infantry Division! The\n",
      "106th Infantry Division, if you know anything about the Battle of the Bulge, they\n",
      "took the brunt of it. They were a brand new division, they brought them in there.\n",
      "Now I knew quite a few of those officers. They were on the right flank and the\n",
      "106th just brought in to relieve and the Germans with the Battle of the Bulge went\n",
      "through the 106th. They had a lot of casualties and a lot of the guys from my OCS\n",
      "class went to the 106th. I didn’t make that choice I went to Fort Bragg.\n",
      "NC: It sounds like you would follow daily what was going on the Western Front and\n",
      "what the infantry was doing. Was there a feeling with you colleagues and\n",
      "comrades about what some of the generals were doing? What Eisenhower was\n",
      "doing? What Patton was doing, etc? You focused more on your role and your\n",
      "responsibilities?\n",
      "MC: No. We didn’t talk much about that. Probably didn’t know that much about what\n",
      "was going on.\n",
      "NC: After you flew your 35th mission, what was the protocol? You don’t have to fly\n",
      "any more missions? Do you leave the Army? What happens?\n",
      "MC: No. You go back for rotation. What they do automatically they put on my\n",
      "rotation slip suggestion or qualifies as instructor. They put that down\n",
      "automatically. Something happened that was real bad. I had finished up and I\n",
      "22\n",
      "came into my hut one day and I walked in, it was in the afternoon. I was waiting\n",
      "for my orders to go back to the States. I walked in and right across from where I\n",
      "was sleeping, my bed, there was two guys from the supply section in there and\n",
      "they were getting the footlockers and the clothes for the Smerntsky’s crew. There\n",
      "were 4 on that crew and they went down. Two planes when down that day, it was\n",
      "a shame. Smerntsky was killed; most of his crew and his co-pilot had just been\n",

      "parents come over from Italy?\n",
      "AD: Yes. My dad came over; he was single at the time. And after that my mother came from the same\n",
      "town as they did and she was living with her brother down there in the lower part of the Hill\n",
      "District. And of course they knew each other from the town in Italy.\n",
      "JZ: What town was that?\n",
      "AD: That was a town that was on top of a mountain outside of Naples, it was called Altavilla Irpina.\n",
      "But anyhow, my dad emigrated, he went to New York first and then he spent a little bit of time in\n",
      "Boston, and then he came back here to Verona, what year I don’t know. Then he had a brother he\n",
      "called for. He came over and he stayed on East Railroad Avenue too, in a house that my dad\n",
      "owned and he died as a young man. Then he met my mother and they got married on East\n",

      "didn’t speak Italian and he ended up a cripple. Then when he came down to Verona he got a job\n",
      "at the Union Steel down in Lawrenceville, but that was only a few days a week. Then when the\n",
      "Depression hit in ’29 everybody was out of work, nobody was working. People were on relief,\n",
      "getting whatever they could- food gets so much, we got seven of us in the family, we got seven\n",

      "JZ: Now when you said relief, who gave that to you, that seven dollars a week?\n",
      "AD: Welfare.\n",
      "JZ: Would it be the government? Federal U.S. government?\n",
      "AD: Yes, that’s when Roosevelt brought in Social Security and the three C’s and WPA. At least\n",
      "people worked for it. But we had two houses in Verona, and my mother said when we all started\n",
      "to work, she told them to call them up and asked them how much do we owe you? So we sold one\n",
      "house, the house I was born in. Told my brother, I forget what it was, a couple grand or\n",
      "something. Sold the house and sent the check in and paid them off for what we got for relief.\n",
      "JZ: Oh really? You had to pay them back?\n",
      "AD: Yeah, we didn’t have to, 'cause at that time they was in the house they had a lean against the\n",
      "house if you ever sold it. But it was in the family until not too long ago but then my mother said\n",
      "well we’ll sell it. And I had my oldest brother call down and ask him and it was around two grand\n",
      "or something, and sold the house and sent it in. But we didn’t have to, we could have held onto\n",
      "the house and wouldn’t have had to pay nothin’ but she wanted to pay them. She appreciated that\n",
      "we got something to live on. Seven dollars a week, a dollar per person.\n",
      "JZ: She wanted to do what was right.\n",
      "AD: She wanted to pay it off and we did. It’s on record.\n",
      "JZ: Did you grow up speaking Italian?\n",
      "2\n",
      "AD: Oh yes well, the whole five of us spoke Italian before we even learned to speak American. ‘Cause\n",
      "even when we were at the school, my oldest brother, when he went they didn’t understand him,\n",
      "they asked him what his name was he says my name’s Pellegrino, that’s Italian. And his name\n",
      "means William. So we learned to speak Italian because all around us was Italian people.\n",
      "JZ: Yeah tell me about the Italian community in Verona.\n",
      "AD: Did you know the Loggi’s?\n",
      "JZ: No…\n",
      "AD: Well they lived next door to us. The Procoppio’s lived there, back in the Procoppio’s house\n",
      "would be caddy corner to where your homestead was in Verona.\n",
      "JZ: The Ricupero’s?\n",
      "AD: Ricupero’s down there too, Jimmy Ricupero. The Maiollos was there and the DiLibertos and we\n",
      "was all mostly all Italians. There was about eight or nine families on that one block plus what was\n",
      "across the railroad tracks. So it was a mostly Italian community. All the people were good, even\n",
      "the non-Italians were nice people, we all got along fine. Everybody knew everybody, you needed\n",
      "help, somebody was there but we all got along which was good.\n",
      "JZ: What did your family life… did your father join any clubs in Verona, Italian clubs, or did he\n",
      "make wine, play bocce, anything that stands out in your mind?\n",
      "AD: My dad made wine as far back as I can remember, always. He only drank a glass of water just for\n",
      "the fun of it. We’d tease him about it. You know, he’d make five, six bottles of wine they were\n",
      "fifty, sixty young barrels too. And we drank wine and on Sundays all the Italians, mostly paisans\n",
      "would come to our house and they would play cards. Briscola, tressette, [underbus], whoever\n",
      "won, they got to drink the wine and who won could give it to this guy, this guy, this guy, and it\n",
      "would be Sunday. They had a good time. Every Sunday they’d come to the house, and drink wine\n",
      "and if my mother had some stuff, salami or sopressata or whatever and she’d put it out, and we\n",
      "were kids running around but nobody had anything, but we had a wonderful time. We really did.\n",
      "At that time, your dad gonna take you out to play baseball, or football? No way! We had a big\n",
      "3\n",
      "garden up on top of the hill there, up on South Verona Hill. Man, we came from school we all\n",
      "went to that garden and we worked; we had a big garden. And that’s what we did, my mother\n",
      "canned a lot of stuff.\n",
      "JZ: So it was your dad’s garden, that was his, he owned that?\n",
      "AD: Oh yes. Well we had the garden, but not the ground. Everybody had, all the Italians had a piece of\n",
      "ground up there. Big, big piece of ground. And that’s how most of it went in charge [ ?], my\n",
      "mother canned a lot of it and of course she baked bread all the time and I never ate store bought\n",
      "bread until I left home. She always baked bread, made handmade macaronis, her own sauce,\n",
      "everything. Then ‘course we used to go out, we used to pick the stuff, we’d haul it from South\n",
      "Verona Hill down past across the boulevard and home and we’d sell it. Sell corn, 15 cents a\n",
      "dozen, tomatoes, peppers.\n",
      "JZ: What kind of vegetables, items did you have in your garden? Corn, tomatoes?\n",
      "AD: Everything. Tomatoes, corn, we had greens, we had peppers, any kind of vegetable you wanted,\n",
      "we had.\n",
      "JZ: So this produce, especially during the Depression, this helped sustain your diet, you couldn’t go\n",
      "to the supermarket and have the money to buy this stuff?\n",
      "AD: My God no, and we used to haul ‘em down on our shoulders, we were kids ten, eleven years old,\n",
      "have bushels on our shoulders, go down like I said, go down past where the DeLiberto’s lived on\n",
      "the hill and then we’d cross the highway, Allegheny River Boulevard and go home. And like I\n",
      "said, we’d sell whatever we could- what we had left, my mother put it all in the can. Jarred\n",
      "everything, hundreds of jars. And that’s the way we sustained, who had money to go out and buy\n",
      "this? Of course everything was cheap too but it was a hard life, but it didn’t hurt any of us, didn’t\n",
      "hurt none of us. We did pretty good, I can’t never say that I went to bed hungry. I can never\n",
      "remember that, ‘cause always something in the house, not the money, but I always had a piece of\n",
      "bread, or we had some salami or olives or whatever.\n",
      "JZ: Like you said you were happy, you had fun too?\n",
      "4\n",
      "AD: Oh God yes, we used to play out in the middle of the street there against the telephone pole there\n",
      "with the railroad tracks past there.\n",
      "JZ: So you didn’t have no TV, no computer?\n",
      "AD: No radio.\n",
      "JZ: No radio! But you had fun, you enjoyed it?\n",
      "AD: Oh yeah, no telephone, no nothing. But we made our own fun. We practically lived down in the\n",
      "river, you know the river wasn’t too far from us. We’d go swimming everyday.\n",
      "JZ: Playing in the river?\n",
      "AD: Oh yeah.\n",
      "JZ: People would say “Oh that’s dangerous, that’s dirty,” no, you’d just go swimming?\n",
      "AD: Yes we would. Of course we never went alone; we always went in a group in case anything\n",
      "happens. When we used to go over we would call the ball dime, that’s where, you know, the part\n",
      "company was over there now, across the railroad tracks?\n",
      "JZ: Is that where Demor Towers is?\n",
      "AD: Yes, now we used to go over there, there’s nothing there but shacks that the old railroaders used\n",
      "to stay in occasionally, and we played there with rocks and stuff. We played, we had a good time,\n",
      "played softball, baseball wasn’t big at that time, it was all softball, mushball.\n",
      "JZ: Mushball? What was mushball?\n",
      "AD: Mushball was a bigger ball than a softball and it was mushier, that’s what they called mushball.\n",
      "Then after that we’d go right into the river, we decided to go swimming. We had a good time.\n",
      "JZ: Where did you go to school at? St. Joe’s?\n",
      "5\n",
      "AD: Verona. I went to St. Joe’s a few years. That’s when they had the nuns and that’s when we had to\n",
      "go in the morning and fire up the stoves for the heat, they were all wooden buildings and the\n",
      "outhouses was outside. Yeah. Then I went to transfer. They were tough, but man they could teach\n",
      "ya. Because there was only seventh grade and eighth grade you went to the public school then.\n",
      "We knew everything already; we were a year ahead because of the discipline of the nuns, boy.\n",
      "They smack your hands with them rulers man they didn’t care. They were tough but, like I said,\n",
      "they didn’t hurt anybody.\n",
      "JZ: I’m curious to know, you know both your parents were from Italy, and they weren’t around at the\n",
      "time when Mussolini came to power, but did your father might ever talk about Italy when you\n",
      "were growing up and what was going on over there, did they know what was occurring?\n",
      "AD: Well, my, I asked my dad one time, I say “Pop…” I don’t know I was maybe twelve, thirteen\n",
      "years old, I said, “Would you like to go back to Italy and visit?” And the funniest thing is my dad\n",
      "says, “No! There’s nothing over there for me.” And his mother was still living, over there. He had\n",
      "such a hard time over there as a child, when you went to work over there you was seven, eight,\n",
      "nine years old. If they paid you pennies a day, my mother the same way. My mother had, I think\n",
      "she had two or three years of school, my dad had one. Now for my dad to say, no, there’s nothing\n",
      "over there for me, he loved this country, even though he come up during the Depression. Because\n",
      "they worked hard over there, he used to tell me he’d go out and pick the olives and the figs and\n",
      "hoe the gardens you know for the landowners. And they had it tough. So I can understand now,\n",
      "why he said he didn’t want to go. And his mother was there yet, you know. But they used to write\n",
      "all the time and he would do what he could, send a buck or two whenever he could, but we didn’t\n",
      "have it ourselves over here.\n",
      "JZ: And he never went back?\n",
      "AD: No, he never went back. But he had brothers over there.\n",
      "JZ: Did he become an American citizen?\n",
      "AD: Oh yeah. He and my mother.\n",
      "6\n",
      "JZ: Do you know when?\n",
      "AD: I have no idea when, I don’t know. But then you had to learn. You hadda learn how to speak it a\n",
      "little bit and learn to read and write your name or whatever before you became a citizen, see they\n",
      "had to go Downtown to the courthouse and they had to learn a little bit about everything before\n",
      "you got your papers. And they both did. I mean, my mother and dad both spoke English… I mean\n",
      "they killed it but you could understand what they were saying. But at least they learned.\n",
      "JZ: Tell me about as a young man, what did you think, what did you know what was going on in\n",
      "Europe and over in Japan, the Pacific? I guess by that time in the late ‘30’s, early ‘40’s before the\n",
      "war, you were in high school at the time. What did you know about what was going on, what\n",
      "were your thoughts about it?\n",
      "AD: Well I really didn’t have no thoughts and ‘course I never graduated high school. I quit high\n",
      "school when I was sixteen years of age. Went to work right away, you know.\n",
      "JZ: Where was that?\n",
      "AD: Carried a little bit of hod for a plaster man and then I went to work for the water company. This\n",
      "was back in 1940. For thirty-five cents an hour I was a flagman and then when the job was done\n",
      "there, I went to work where the Giant Eagle is now in American Steel Foundries. Went to work in\n",
      "a steel mill. And then from there, ‘course I caddied everyday too, when you got to be twelve\n",
      "years old you got your working papers in the school. Me and all my other three brothers we went\n",
      "caddying at Longue Vue Country Club. To make a few extra bucks.\n",
      "JZ: That was a hike!\n",
      "AD: A hike? We used to hitchhike; you had to wait about an hour for a car to come by because nobody\n",
      "had cars back then! Oh we used to hitchhike right there at the beginning where the old police\n",
      "station was. Used to hitchhike, but you hadda wait for a car to go by, because no one had cars in\n",
      "them days. That was 1939.\n",
      "JZ: Nobody had cars?\n",
      "7\n",
      "AD: Well they had cars, but there wasn’t that many. You had to wait for a car to come by to hitch a\n",
      "ride.\n",
      "JZ: I can’t imagine that, Allegheny River Boulevard, having no cars.\n",
      "AD: I remember when they put that in, too. We used to hitchhike from there down to, you know where\n",
      "Nadine pump station is? Down to there, and then either walk up or one of the members going up\n",
      "to the Longue Vue Country Club would pick us up. And then come back, we’d do the same thing.\n",
      "JZ: Well tell me about, working at the country club, of course you were a caddy… there wasn’t very\n",
      "many Italians at that time, members…\n",
      "AD: Oh no, I can’t remember one. I can’t remember one Italian member. Not one. No.\n",
      "JZ: How was it working at the club?\n",
      "AD: Caddying wasn’t bad; some members were very nice even though they had money, you know,\n",
      "some of them were pretty good. You get good and bad in everybody. And you have to take it,\n",
      "what are you gonna do, you’re caddying there, and you want that dollar and a quarter and you did\n",
      "what you were told, and that’s it. But they weren’t bad, they weren’t bad people to work for, them\n",
      "was real nice people.\n",
      "JZ: A dollar and a quarter, that’s it.\n",
      "AD: A dollar and a quarter for eighteen holes.\n",
      "JZ: That’s the standard rate, or is that…\n",
      "AD: That’s the rate for eighteen holes.\n",
      "JZ: Did you get a tip with that too?\n",
      "AD: If they give you a tip- some of them did, some of them didn’t, it all depends. I didn’t get out\n",
      "everyday though; I went seven days a week, all of us went seven days a week to caddying. I only\n",
      "8\n",
      "got out Saturday and Sunday. Monday till Friday, forget it, but I went, in case there was a\n",
      "tournament. If there was a tournament, then there were a lot of people. We went seven days a\n",
      "week, and maybe got out Saturday and Sunday because that’s when everybody come out to play.\n",
      "JZ: And that’s of course during the summer time?\n",
      "AD: Oh yes. My mother used to pack our lunch, peppers and eggs, and them guys wanted to buy them\n",
      "off of us, too.\n",
      "JZ: When you say peppers in eggs, in just a sandwich?\n",
      "AD: Fried, my mother used to fry the peppers with the eggs in there and then put the sandwich in,\n",
      "homemade bread. She’d pack our own lunches, and we’d go there seven days a week.\n",
      "JZ: Christ, you could probably charge three dollars for that!\n",
      "AD: You know what, they’d steal them off of you too, you know, them was good eatin’ then.\n",
      "JZ: It’s hard to imagine, you went to work seven days a week as a young twelve year old, not even a\n",
      "teenager, to make money.\n",
      "AD: Yes, then that’s not counting working up in the garden too, all summer too. And we had a little\n",
      "garden behind the house, on East Railroad Avenue.\n",
      "JZ: Well, twelve year old kids today have it lucky!\n",
      "AD: Oh, you kidding? They don’t know how good they got it.\n",
      "JZ: I guess by ’40, ’41 when the Japanese attacked, did you know, I mean what was going on?\n",
      "AD: Like I say, I was about just turned eighteen. And at that age, you think, well what can you think,\n",
      "you don’t know until you get into it. So I never really give it much thought. But then it wasn’t too\n",
      "long then I was drafted at eighteen.\n",
      "9\n",
      "JZ: And that was 1943? When you were eighteen?\n",
      "AD: Yeah, 1943.\n",
      "JZ: Did you see many of the guys you knew, maybe your friends in Verona that were being drafted\n",
      "before you in ’42, I guess, did you see them go?\n",
      "AD: No. Because they were a year or two younger than me, they went after I did, ‘cause we all lived\n",
      "together, we were all Italians then, the Bosco’s, Liberto’s, we all lived together there and they\n",
      "were a year or two younger than me. So they went in after I did.\n",
      "JZ: So when you got your draft notice, you were to report, you had to go downtown?\n",
      "AD: Oh yeah, well when I got my draft notice, they told you that you had to go downtown, get your\n",
      "physical. They give you a physical and then you go home, I forget for how long. Then they sent\n",
      "me to training grounds at Aberdeen, Maryland.\n",
      "JZ: Is that Fort Meade?\n",
      "AD: Fort Meade, yes. And they interviewed me there, that’s where they interviewed everybody that\n",
      "went there. ‘Course we took off from Wilkinsburg Station to Aberdeen, Maryland and they had a\n",
      "big room, rec room. They would set you down and interview you. Ask ya all kind of questions.\n",
      "So he’s asking me, “Did you graduate,” I said “No, I quit school at sixteen”, and about your\n",
      "mother and father and stuff like that. And he says to me, “What branch of the service do you want\n",
      "to go?” I says “Well, I’d like to try the Marines.” And he says, “Pick another branch.” I says,\n",
      "“Ok, I’ll go into the Navy.” He says “Well, I think what I’m gonna do is I’m gonna put you in the\n",
      "army.” I say “Why did you ask me what branch of the service I wanted to go, if you knew all\n",
      "along you was gonna put me in the army?” Which I didn’t care, and he sort of smiled and he says\n",
      "“I’ll tell you the truth, because you don’t have a high school education.” He said “That’s why, or\n",
      "else you could be in any branch you wanted to.” I says, ok, I didn’t care; I didn’t much care. So\n",
      "then ok, put me in the army and they send us over to the quartermasters, they give us our\n",
      "uniforms. Shoes, they just take a look at you and they throw this on there, they have to give you\n",
      "shoes about that big and I said “Hey these feel kinda big”, he says “Well exchange them wherever\n",
      "10\n",
      "you go”, because you got hundreds and thousands of guys coming through there. They can’t take\n",
      "enough time to measure your feet.\n",
      "Then from there they shipped us down to Hattiesburg, Mississippi, that’s Camp Shelby, big army\n",
      "camp down there. And they put me in the 69th division. That was one of the known divisions in\n",
      "World War I, the fighting 69th. Anyhow, they shipped us there and they wanted to. ‘Course we\n",
      "went on our 25 mile hiking trips and we went through basic training which was tough. Man, you\n",
      "ate your muscle, but they didn’t care man, everyday you went through that, but it was good, I\n",
      "mean you ate and everything, but it was fine. So then finally they give us a couple weeks to go\n",
      "home. So I went home on furlough. There was nobody around at that time, they were all gone\n",
      "then. Some were gone to the service, then there was nobody around. As a matter of fact it was\n",
      "boring to be at home in Verona! I couldn’t wait to get back. So anyhow when we got back to\n",
      "camp they said we’re gonna get shipped overseas. I says ok. So the lieutenant comes out there\n",
      "and he had the sheet and he’s gonna read all the names off, alphabetical order, the guys that’s\n",
      "gonna ship out. And he’s readin’ the names, he gets down to the D’s, and he gets past the D’s but\n",
      "my name wasn’t on there. And when it was all over, he says, ok we got another list here,\n",
      "supernumerary. I don’t know if you know what that means? Supernumerary means if nobody can\n",
      "go, then they’ll pick somebody from this group. But I was in that group not to go.\n",
      "Well when my name wasn’t called I went up to the lieutenant I said “Hey, you passed me up, I\n",
      "didn’t hear my name!” He says “Oh you’re on the second list.” I says “What are you talking\n",
      "about, on the second list? You mean I’m not going?” He says, no, I’m unlisted. I says “Oh no no\n",
      "no no, I’m going. I wanna go, I wanna go with my friends.” He says, “There’s nothing I can do\n",
      "about it.” Man I was really down and out. I says “Well I’m not gonna let it go.” So I went to the\n",
      "headquarters. And I asked to speak to the captain in charge there. So I goes in and he said “What\n",
      "can I do for you son?”, and I said “Listen, my list is shipping overseas, I’m not on that list, how\n",
      "come I’m not on that list, I wanna go!” And he says “I’m sorry, I had nothing to do with this, this\n",
      "comes from headquarters.” Well why me? He says “I’m sorry I can’t help you.” I says “I want to\n",
      "go, I don’t want to stay here.” So then he said “I’m sorry”, and I left, I felt so bad. Then the next\n",
      "day the lieutenant comes up to me, he says, “Hey I don’t know what you did but you’re going,\n",
      "you’re on the list.” I was so happy to go. So anyhow, we get together and they ship us to Newport\n",
      "News, Virginia. That’s where we were shipping out from there. So they say we’re going to be in a\n",
      "convoy of about 500 ships. We didn’t know where we were going.\n",
      "11\n",
      "JZ: Go back to Newport News. I’d like to know, you wanted this so bad, was this to be with your\n",
      "friends, or to get out of the states, to get in the war theatre…?\n",
      "AD: I felt if I didn’t go then I would be like a slacker or something. I wanted to go because I was with\n",
      "my friends and I didn’t want anybody to say that I wasn’t picked to go overseas because there\n",
      "was a war on, them was the two main things, that’s why I wanted to go.\n",
      "JZ: So you were in Newport News in this convoy?\n",
      "AD: Well they told us there was a convoy of five hundred ships, they had some submarine destroyers\n",
      "to protect us, going with us, and anyhow they loaded us 500 guys to a ship; they were a liberty\n",
      "ship commanded by the Merchant Marines. It was nose to nose in the bunk. Anyhow we boards\n",
      "‘em and we go out to sea and they anchored out there waiting for the convoy, for everybody to\n",
      "come in there. Well still we don’t know where we’re going. So we’re out, finally the next\n",
      "morning, the convoy’s ready, we take off. But we’re zigzagging to avoid the submarines. And\n",
      "they called for chow time. So we give them our ID, they give us a cup of some kind of juice and a\n",
      "cracker about eight inches round. I says ok. We go down the line and says “Where’s the rest of\n",
      "it?” He says “Well that’s it.” I said what are you talking about this, we’re gonna starve here,\n",
      "that’s it, that one cracker a day with something to drink all day. Man, the guys were starving. We\n",
      "couldn’t survive on that. So somebody broke into the hole of the ship. And down under there they\n",
      "found crates and crates of C-rations, K-rations, that’s what they used to use, man them things was\n",
      "coming out of there until they dished them out to everybody. When they found out man, they\n",
      "went down there they were over them hatches shut! Because that stuff was supposed to go for\n",
      "overseas, but we were starving!\n",
      "JZ: Really?\n",
      "AD: Yeah! And as we were going man, we hit one heck of a storm. That bulb ship or boat, whatever\n",
      "they want to call it, that thing, you’d see the wave come up, and then some would come down,\n",
      "boom, you’d see nothing but water. And here, I was almost washed overboard, I should have been\n",
      "inside- here, good thing I grabbed onto a rope or I’d still be swimming.\n",
      "[End Tape 1, Side A]\n",
      "[Begin Tape 1, Side B]\n",
      "12\n",
      "AD: Anyhow, you hear a shrill whistling and somebody would come out over the microphone and say,\n",
      "“the smoking lamp is out.” I says, well what is this, the smoking lamp’s out? I says, “the lamp’s\n",
      "out, light it!” Here they tell us after what it is… no smoking. I didn’t smoke anyhow. No smoking\n",
      "because if this submarine’s out, they see a flicker of light, or something, they might think there’s\n",
      "something out there. Ok so they told me that’s what it means, no smoking. And then they talk,\n",
      "starboard side, port side, front of the ship, back, this is that, I says, what are they talking about? I\n",
      "didn’t know that language. They say the port side is the right side of the ship, this is the left side,\n",
      "aft is the back, I says why don’t they call it like it is then? Well anyhow, it took us thirty days at\n",
      "sea, thirty days to the day. Finally, we spotted land.\n",
      "JZ: When did you leave?\n",
      "AD: Oh I don’t remember the day.\n",
      "JZ: What year, ’43 or ’44?\n",
      "AD: Oh yeah, ’43. ‘Cause I was drafted in ’43, and 12, 13 weeks of basic training. Then right after\n",
      "that, it wasn’t too long, 3 or 4 months and then we’re gone. Anyhow here we landed at\n",
      "Casablanca, Africa. So we was there at the camp, had sixteen to a big tent and they told us, listen,\n",
      "when you go to bed you sleep with your rifle next to you because them Arabs in Casablanca there\n",
      "you know Oran, it was Oran, Casablanca. They’ll break into the camp steal whatever you got,\n",
      "maybe even cut your throat. Every once in awhile you’d hear machine gun fire, someone’d try to\n",
      "get in and they’d shoot him. Well anyhow, we got leave to go into Oran. Lot of French over there\n",
      "too in Oran and in Algiers and that. So then they said now when you go into town, don’t venture\n",
      "out alone. Always be in a group, five or five, ‘cause you don’t know what’s going to happen. And\n",
      "make sure, the truck is gonna come back, make sure you’re there to pick you up because we’re\n",
      "not running a taxi service here. If you don’t catch it, you miss it. You miss the truck back to\n",
      "camp. So we made damn sure, but anyhow, we was there for maybe about a week or two so they\n",
      "shipped us to the train station and they loaded us on, really, cattle cars is what they were. They\n",
      "used to haul cattle in them on the railroad. They put eighty of us to each car. You couldn’t lay\n",
      "down to sleep, you hadda sit down with your knees up. And occasionally they would stop, you’d\n",
      "get off and eat something, and stretch your legs, get back on again. It took us three days to get\n",
      "from Oran to Algiers. We went to Algiers. And then we’d go through the tunnels. Now these here\n",
      "13\n",
      "were steam engines that burned coal. And when we went through the tunnels, all that smoke,\n",
      "where was it gonna go? Everybody was coughin’ and hackin’, all that black soot and smoke\n",
      "coming in there, man, we couldn’t wait to get the heck out of there; we went through three\n",
      "tunnels and almost choked to death! From the smoke, from the coal, yeah it’s poisonous! Well\n",
      "anyhow finally we got to Algiers. Took us to camp, and in the camp they were starving us too, we\n",
      "gettin’ one meal a day and everybody got dysentery.\n",
      "JZ: Now what’s that?\n",
      "AD: Diarrhea. And man you’d see guys gettin’ up and running for the latrine, and when they stopped,\n",
      "goodbye, that means they let everything go, they couldn’t make it. But there was one place there,\n",
      "the Arabs, they were selling some beautiful oranges, they were like that (gestures with hands),\n",
      "thick skin, nice. But to get any of those you had to be there early in the morning waitin’ for them\n",
      "to open up and they would always sell up ‘cause you’re talking thousands of soldiers there. If you\n",
      "were lucky enough, then you got some or at least you ate some oranges or something. Well\n",
      "anyhow we got orders to ship out again. So they take us to the seashore and there was an English\n",
      "transport ship there. I mean I thought it was the Merrimack from the Civil War, that’s how old it\n",
      "was and cranky. It was a troop ship, it belonged to the English. We boarded that at night. So we\n",
      "takes off, we go through the straits of Sicily and the mainland was to the right. So we spotted\n",
      "land. I was at the front of the ship. And you know a funny feeling come over to me, ‘cause I said,\n",
      "“That’s where my mother and father were born!” They probably took off from the port of Naples\n",
      "to come to America and it left me with a funny feeling.\n",
      "So then when we got off of the boat they took us to the, it’s called Mussolini’s Race Track. That’s\n",
      "where we had big tents and we camped there. And this one time they called us for chow. We went\n",
      "to chow, they had some meat, it sort of had a sweet taste and it was stringy and real red, and I\n",
      "says “What kind of meat is this?” and one guy says, “That’s horse meat.” I says, “What are you\n",
      "talking about, they won’t feed us no horse meat.” He says, “This is a race track, isn’t it?” I say,\n",
      "“Well what’s that got to do with it?” He says, “I tell you it’s horse meat!” I didn’t believe him.\n",
      "Anyhow I took off to go back to camp… I was going at a pretty good trot. It could have been\n",
      "horsemeat, I don’t know, because it was different, not like beef, it was different. They probably\n",
      "made a joke, maybe it was, maybe it wasn’t.\n",
      "JZ: Was it good?\n",
      "14\n",
      "AD: Well, when you’re hungry you’ll eat anything! Well anyhow they come round then and they give\n",
      "us patches, they had put me in the 36th Infantry Division out of Texas. And they gave us the\n",
      "patches and we had to sew them on our jackets.\n",
      "JZ: You had to sew them on yourself?\n",
      "AD: You sew them on yourself, you had a little sewing kit, or there was somebody around camp make\n",
      "a few bucks who would sew ‘em on for you, you know, put ‘em on your sleeve. On your shirts,\n",
      "on your sleeves or whatever. Come the time to ship out and they loaded us on the trucks, it was at\n",
      "night because we’re headed towards the front lines now. So when we get to the bottom of the\n",
      "mountain, you could hear some shooting going on, big stuff, not small stuff. So we stayed there\n",
      "over night, it was cold, this was in January. We dug our fox hole, laid in there, slept at night, if\n",
      "you could sleep. Next morning we all line up, just waiting. So then three of us started to climb\n",
      "this mountain that was near, me and two other guys. So finally they blew the whistle, come on\n",
      "back down and get together, we’re ready. So we comes down and this one lieutenant, he wasn’t\n",
      "from our outfit, I don’t know who the heck he was, and he said “The three guys that climbed up\n",
      "in that mountain there, partway, who were you, raise your hands.” And I’m saying to myself,\n",
      "“Why’s he wanna know why we climbed the mountain?” Two of the guys raised their hands. And\n",
      "me, from boot camp, a guy told me, an old sergeant, he said never volunteer for anything unless\n",
      "you know what it is. So that thought came to me, I said I ain’t gonna put my hand up. So I didn’t.\n",
      "I just put my head down. He said “Who is this, one more guy, one more guy.” I said nothing. So\n",
      "anyhow he told the two guys, come with me. They went. So I’m asking around and I say, “Why\n",
      "did he take the two guys there?” He says “Well they want to make mule skinners out of them.” I\n",
      "say “What are you talking about, they gonna skin some mules and eat ‘em, or what?” He says no.\n",
      "There’s a lot of mountains over there now to go up to the front lines and that they used mules.\n",
      "And they needed soldiers to guide ‘em up, with ammunition and food and that. And that’s what\n",
      "they wanted them for. Well I wasn’t gonna be no mule skinner! So I got out of that. Yeah, I didn’t\n",
      "volunteer, I says no, I ain’t gonna put my hand up, not me, I don’t wanna be no mule skinner!\n",
      "Well anyhow, so then we starts up to the top of the mountain, I forget the name of it.\n",
      "JZ: This is near Naples?\n",
      "15\n",
      "AD: Well it was outside of Naples, yeah. And we gets on top and we start to pitch our tent, we had pop\n",
      "tents, two to a tent. We put two of them together so four could sleep, more body heat. Well\n",
      "anyhow, the mailman comes around, mail call, he always would try to get the mail to you as often\n",
      "as they could, once, twice a day, or at least everyday. So we all gathered around. And he’d call\n",
      "the names out and he’d give you your mail. So the one lieutenant he told the mailman, he says,\n",
      "“You’re going back down to camp?” He says yeah. “I want you to tell the cook to bring some\n",
      "fresh donuts and bring some hot coffee up here for these men, ‘cause its cold.” He says ok. So the\n",
      "next morning he comes back up, the mailman, he says “Well did you tell the cookie to bring….”\n",
      "He says “Yeah I told him but he says it’s too dangerous to come up there.” So the lieutenant tells\n",
      "him, he says, “Are you going back down?” He says yeah. “When you go down you tell the cook,\n",
      "either coffee or donuts, or him.” He went down, it wasn’t too much longer, here comes them\n",
      "mules with coffee and donuts. Oh yeah! Brought them up and give it to the guys. Well anyhow\n",
      "nighttime, we went to bed to sleep. Next morning I get up, got out, there must’ve been about four\n",
      "inches of snow on the ground.\n",
      "JZ: In Naples!\n",
      "AD: Outside of Naples, this was in January and up in the mountains now. You were up in the\n",
      "mountains. Four inches of snow on the ground. Now that day was January the 14th. And the\n",
      "reason I remember that because I just turned nineteen years of age. I didn’t even tell the guys I\n",
      "was with there, never said a word to nobody. I was afraid well maybe they’s gonna say well hey\n",
      "come on let’s go, I’ll take you into town, we’ll have some dinner and get a few drinks, I’m just\n",
      "joking now. But no, I never said a word to nobody. But anyhow, you know we go on watches,\n",
      "four hours on, four hours off. So many guys. So we was in a wooded area and off to the right of\n",
      "us was like a plateau, it had big rocks. And as you’re lookin out over, you’re looking out over the\n",
      "river, the Rapido River over onto Monte Cassino. That’s the abbey where the monks were. Well\n",
      "anyhow, me and two other guys was there plus our captain of the company was there. So the\n",
      "captain looks down at me, he says, “Hey soldier” he says; well first of all when you’re on watch\n",
      "there he says, don’t move around too much because if you moved around they’d seen you\n",
      "moving, the Germans, they’d lob a few shells in there, you know. He says we don’t want that, just\n",
      "lay low, ok just make sure nobody’s coming. So the captain comes to me he says “Soldier, how\n",
      "‘bout going down there and get the heater.” There was little heaters that we had, and he says\n",
      "“And we’ll have some hot chocolate.” ‘Cause we used to get candy bars and you’d melt them for\n",
      "hot chocolate. And he said “Hey soldier go down and get the stove and bring it up.” I says “If you\n",
      "16\n",
      "want it go down and get it yourself”, I told the captain. Then it hit me, I said oh my God he’s\n",
      "gonna court-marshal me and put me against the wall and shoot me down like a dog ‘cause I\n",
      "disobeyed an order. Oh, it was on my mind. So finally our shift was over and I’m going back to\n",
      "the camp and I’m talking to some of the sergeants and that and I says they’re gonna court-marshal\n",
      "me. And the sergeant says “No, nothing’s going to happen to you.” I said “What are you talking\n",
      "about, I disobeyed the captain.” “I’m gonna tell you something”, he says “read your book. No\n",
      "officer or non-commissioned officer is to tell you what to do if they wouldn’t do it themselves.\n",
      "He didn’t go down and get the stove, did he?” I said no, he told me, “Then he was wrong.\n",
      "Nothing will happen to you.” He was right. They don’t tell any soldier to do anything that they\n",
      "wouldn’t do themselves. He wouldn’t do it. So nothing ever happened. And it’s in the code book.\n",
      "The guy told me.\n",
      "Well anyhow we’re getting ready, he came around, we’re gonna cross the Rapido River and put\n",
      "an attack on Monte Cassino. Ok, I’m not worried about it. So we all get together. He says, “Now\n",
      "they’re gonna put the smoke pots out, so there’s all smoke. And when we’re headed down I want\n",
      "you to hold the backpack of the guy in front of you, because you can’t see nothing.” And the guy\n",
      "on the side of you, we were really piled in there, so we started down the mountain, run into the\n",
      "smoke, we grabbed the guy in front of me and on the side. Going down, all of a sudden all hell\n",
      "broke loose. It was artillery shell come in there; it blew the smoke away, lit up the sky. Oh my\n",
      "God in heaven, I was seein’ bodies ripped apart, three or four piled on top of each other. I\n",
      "couldn’t believe my eyes. This part all shot off, I just couldn’t believe it. And then within seconds\n",
      "another one hit, same thing, another pile of mangled bodies. “Oh my God,” I said. So I was just in\n",
      "the side of the bank, I hit the ground; I didn’t want to see anymore. Nobody could see nothing,\n",
      "nobody was giving commands, so I said well, “I gotta do something” so I got up and I headed\n",
      "forward to get away from it. I come to the river and I’m looking down the river, they had pontoon\n",
      "bridges stretched from one side, 'cause it wasn’t a wide river but it was swift and it was high\n",
      "because of all the snow we had in the mountains was melting. And the current was like hell. And\n",
      "I looked downstream and there’s soldiers down there crossing, the bridge breaking loose, they’re\n",
      "falling into the water with all their gear on and drowning and I seen one or two of them break\n",
      "loose. I look upstream and the bridge was there. I says, well, I gotta get across here, that’s what\n",
      "we’re supposed to do. I gotta get across this bridge. I wonder if I can make it. So I got up, I was\n",
      "by myself, I headed across and I hit the other side of the bank, the riverbank and I didn’t want to\n",
      "put my head up because there was a lot of small arms fire coming, gonna shoot my head off here.\n",
      "But I had to look! Because I was looking maybe if they would sometimes counter attack. And if\n",
      "17\n",
      "they did, I didn’t want to be caught with my head down. And I was there all by myself. The rest\n",
      "of them were still back there, charred up.\n",
      "So then finally I heard an order come by, says, “fall back to the positions.” I looked back the\n",
      "bridge was still there, I says “I gotta get back there again?” But I hit that bridge, man, I took so\n",
      "many steps I got on the other side and headed back up towards the mountain through the smoke\n",
      "back up in. When I got up on top, man I was cold. I was red, I was tired, I just put my head\n",
      "between my legs and I just couldn’t believe what I saw. I couldn’t get it out of my mind. And\n",
      "when I got home, I got nightmares. I was afraid to go to sleep. I’d stay up as long as I could, but it\n",
      "didn’t work. It still nightmares. It took a good while, but finally it went away, and thank God I\n",
      "could at least sleep again. Well anyhow I’m sitting there, the lieutenant comes by and he says\n",
      "“Put some dry socks on, we’re going back again tonight.” I said oh my God, I won’t make it, I\n",
      "won’t be back, I can’t be that lucky with what went on. I couldn’t rest, I didn’t even eat, I didn’t\n",
      "put no dry clothes on. I just sat there all day. Finally nighttime comes and they assembled us all\n",
      "together. And they say well this time we’re not gonna have the smoke pots out. I says thank God,\n",
      "whoever the idiot was that ordered them should be shot. We lost a lot of men on account of them,\n",
      "‘cause they hit us right in the middle! We were packed in like sardines! They knew where we\n",
      "were and we knew where they were. Shouldn’t a had them smoke pots. Anyhow we’re not gonna\n",
      "have them. We start back down the mountain. We’re getting close to the place where all hell\n",
      "broke out. I’m trying to brace myself for what’s coming. How do you do that? How do you brace\n",
      "yourself for something like that?\n",

      "so much alike, you look like twins.” We weren’t. Getting back to the river. Me and my look-\n",

      "We’re the first ones across. So the lieutenant looks down at me and says “Let’s go.” I said “Ok\n",
      "let’s go.” I got up and there was a field there. Beyond the field was Monte Cassino on the mount\n",
      "there. And this field, was no trees. It looked like it was cultivated for something, I don’t know,\n",
      "maybe they growed wheat on it for when the monks ground it for flour; maybe it made the secret\n",
      "recipe for their bread, I don’t know. It might have been some kind of a field. Anyhow I get up, we\n",
      "started across. My buddy was to my left behind me. The lieutenant was on the side, and we’re\n",
      "going towards Monte Cassino. So I look to the left and there was my buddy. To the left of him\n",
      "was the lieutenant and on the other side of the lieutenant was a big gap before the other company.\n",
      "Well I don’t know how far away they were. I look behind me… nobody there. No soldiers,\n",
      "nobody there they were back at the river or still trying to cross. And I’m out there fifty, sixty feet\n",
      "by myself never missed a step. I turned around and I kept going towards Monte Cassino. Nothing,\n",
      "everything was quiet. I says, “Good. They must have left Monte Cassino.” No sooner then I said\n",
      "that, oh my God, a shell come and hit behind me. It blew me two or three feet ahead into a\n",

      "was. I come to, and I felt a pain behind me. I put my hand back in my pants. My pants were\n",
      "ripped. Stuck my hand back in, my finger went inside a hole. And then blood, I knew I was hit.\n",
      "Took that out and I had another sting in my back. I put my hand back there, same thing, my\n",
      "backpack was ripped and my shirt. Put my hand back there, same thing, my finger went in a hole.\n",
      "So then I look over to my buddy to my left. Oh my God. His back was shattered. He probably\n",
      "took the brunt of it. He was gone. I don’t know how you know, I mean he was gone, was dead.\n",
      "He didn’t move, he didn’t yell, he didn’t say nothing.\n",
      "Finally I heard the lieutenant hollering. He says, “You guys alright?” I says, “lieutenant, no, I’m\n",
      "hit in two places. I think my buddy’s gone.” He says, “Well get back to the river, get some help.”\n",
      "I say, “How am I gonna get back there? I’m here hit in two places, there’s nobody around to get\n",

      "help, they’re all back at the river.” Well I have three choices to make. I could either get help try to\n",
      "get back. Stay there, freeze and bleed to death. Or stay there till they capture me. So I say I don’t\n",
      "want any of the two or three, I better take a chance. So I got up, I was fine, I was hurting, and I\n",
      "started back. I had to go fifty, sixty yards back to the river to get any help at all. So as I’m going\n",
      "back there was small arms fire, machine gun, small arms fire going. And I could just feel the\n",
      "bullets going past my legs. How I never got hit again I’ll never know. I could hear them whizzing\n",
      "across me. I must’ve been lucky again. Anyhow, the way back this one shell hits and I see this\n",
      "one soldier bounce about maybe six, seven inches off of the ground. So instead of me going back\n",
      "to the river where the boat is, I cut to my left towards him, ‘cause he was hit. I went over there\n",
      "and sure enough, who the hell was it, it was this Lieutenant Spike, the one that said, “Most of you\n",

      "hit with a bullet. But he was alive yet. He was just moaning. And I said, “We gotta get him out of\n",
      "here, he’s gonna die here” because all this time, the rest of the guys are going back across the\n",
      "river, there’s nobody there. I finally hollered at one guy, one soldier, I said, “Hey! This is\n",
      "Lieutenant Spike here, he’s hit bad, we gotta get him out of here across the river, he’s gonna die!”\n",
      "And he said ok, so we got him, we dragged him down to the riverbank. Put him in the rubber raft.\n",
      "Shimmied across. We didn’t know where the first aid station was, the hospital. I looked across the\n",
      "river, make sure there was nobody there, make sure they were all back across again. I cut the\n",
      "ropes. Put him in that boat. Me on one side, the other guy on the other, I didn’t even know who he\n",
      "was. We started to carry him along the riverbank. And I was hurt and I was bleeding.\n",
      "Finally we run into some soldiers there, we say, “Do you know where the field hospital is?” He\n",
      "says, “You go down here, bear to your left you can’t miss it, you’ll run into it.” So we did, I don’t\n",

      "much. I told my buddy, “Hey we better get out of here. Because if this thing erupts, they’re gonna\n",

      "the sides and everything! So we got out of there, we spent a little time in beautiful churches there,\n",
      "buildings. They got buildings here they’re lucky they stand for 50 years, over there they’re\n",

      "Well anyhow we got out of there before it erupted. From there we got orders to ship out going\n",
      "with the invasion of Anzio. So we went to the seashore. Well the 3rd Division was the one that\n",
      "made the first landing. Whoever thought of that was a very strategic move that they made because\n",
      "they came around Monte Cassino where the Germans was dug in there. There wasn’t a shot fired.\n",
      "We hit the beaches in Anzio and we started straight ahead. And as we started straight ahead\n",

      "he says, “DeFazio, you take the point.” Well you know what the point is? You’re the first one out\n",
      "there and then 50 yards behind me would be the second point then behind him would be the\n",

      "mother and a father back home too he has a family; there he is laying there like a dog. I figured\n",

      "Rome, on this side was the mountains then the other side of the mountain was Rome.\n",
      "They had a gun right outside of Rome. That thing had a shell I betcha it was as big as a streetcar\n",

      "25\n",
      "our planes got up there to get it, it was gone, it was in the mountains you couldn’t get ‘em out.\n",

      "EF: Yes, I started in the post office in the late thirties. Well, of course, I worked\n",
      "in the machine shop after I graduated from 1934 to about 1939 and went to\n",
      "Carnegie Tech. Then I took the examinations and was called in in 1939.\n",

      "Meade. I guess that’s the place, Fort Meade, Maryland. And so you went to\n",
      "Fort Meade and on June 25 you went to Virginia for basic training. Tell me\n",
      "about basic training.\n",
      "EF: We went by train to Virginia. We had our rifles issued. We had rifle drill. We\n",
      "had training on tractors that pulled the 155 guns. We had training on 155\n",
      "millimeter cannons. We fired the cannons across the James River for practice.\n",

      "JZ: Did you know you were going to be in the artillery in basic or no?\n",
      "6\n",
      "EF: No, they chose what branches of service we would go into. I was fortunate to\n",
      "get into artillery rather than infantry.\n",
      "JZ: Like my dad said when he went to Vietnam. So you said something about the\n",
      "James River, you would fire into the James River?\n",
      "EF: Yes. We set up our 155 cannons. They were mobile and were pulled to\n",
      "position with trackers. They gave us training in driving tractors, setting up the\n",
      "guns and firing the guns.\n",
      "JZ: When you say tractors was it a big truck?\n",
      "EF: Bulldozers. A bulldozer-type tractor.\n",
      "JZ: And after Virginia you went to Georgia?\n",
      "EF: Yeah we had three months of maneuvers. No, I’m getting confused. We go to\n",
      "maneuvers from there. We traveled by truck and sat in the back of the army\n",
      "truck. We went to Fort Stuart, Georgia. We called it Camp Stuart but its called\n",

      "the coastguard cannon. We were trained on the 90 millimeter anti-aircraft gun.\n",
      "JZ: That was a much smaller gun, right?\n",
      "EF: Right.\n",
      "JZ: It had one barrel?\n",
      "EF: It was one barrel. It had huge heavy shells. They were drawn by trucks into\n",
      "position. We learned how to set them up and fire them. We also got training\n",
      "7\n",
      "on .50 caliber machine guns. We were issued Garand rifles rather than\n",
      "Springfields. We started with Springfield rifles, then we got the Garand M-1s\n",

      "battery. We had four battery’s A, B, C and D. I was in D-battery. A-battery\n",
      "was comprised of huge search lights and that were five or six feet in diameter\n",
      "and shot a beam up in the sky at night that was unbelievable to search for\n",
      "enemy planes. Three batteries were 90 millimeter batteries and we all had .50\n",
      "caliber guns. We also had range equipment which was electronic computers to\n",
      "judge the range of the targets of the enemy planes.\n",
      "JZ: What did you call these?\n",
      "EF: They were computers. The section that had these was called the Range\n",
      "Section. They also had an instrument that required someone to view through\n",
      "these huge telescopes and judge by merging images on this scope how far the\n",
      "range was to hit this target. We did not try to actually hit the target but put a\n",
      "burst in a pattern in the sky around the target so that they were surrounded.\n",
      "We had all sorts of ammunition for these 90 millimeter guns. We had anti-\n",
      "personal, anti-tank, and anti-airplane. We had smoke shells to indicate how far\n",
      "we were from the target. There were various types of ammunition and they\n",
      "came four shells in a case and they were awful heavy, it took two men to\n",
      "carry.\n",
      "JZ: It took two men to carry for a 90 millimeter gun.\n",
      "EF: They were big brass shells. Now I don’t know what else to tell you.\n",
      "JZ: Tell me about when Pearl Harbor happened.\n",
      "8\n",
      "EF: When we returned from the maneuvers throughout the Carolinas, that was a\n",
      "very exciting time for me. We camped out every night and we belonged to the\n",
      "Blue Army and our enemy was the Red Army. We were split up into to armies\n",
      "and we tried to attack each other. We had bags of flour and if we saw an\n",
      "enemy we hit them with a bag of flour and that way they were marked as\n",
      "prisoners. When we worked our way down from Carolina to Fort Bragg is\n",
      "where we got attacked by paratroopers. Fort Bragg was a paratrooper training\n",
      "center. The sky was completely full of parachutes coming down, it was an\n",
      "unbelievable site. To me it was a bit thrilling but all-in-all I was homesick.\n",
      "Anyhow when we got back to Georgia after maneuvers we were getting set up\n",
      "to get leave to go home. It would be the first leave I would get since I was\n",
      "inducted into the army. However, that Sunday our dear President Roosevelt\n",
      "told us about the Day of Infamy and that Japan had attacked Pearl Harbor. All\n",
      "leaves were canceled so the first leave I was supposed to have was absolutely\n",
      "canceled so it ended up that I never got a leave since I was in the army.\n",
      "Consequently it was four years before I was able to see my loved ones again.\n",
      "At that time we were told that we were ordered by one of the generals to take\n",
      "our regiment up to Baltimore, Maryland to protect the Glen L. Martin B-24\n",
      "Bomber plant up there because the United States intelligence thought that\n",
      "there was a possibility of German subs or U-boats were approaching the\n",
      "harbor and could shell the airplane manufacturer plant. We set up our guns\n",
      "around the plant and things seemed to have calmed down somewhat. So they\n",
      "decided that we would be better useful overseas. It was then judged that we go\n",
      "to the South-West Pacific.\n",
      "JZ: What was your reaction when you heard you were going to the Pacific?\n",
      "EF: I wasn’t too happy about it. Scared. Anyhow, we were going to get into\n",
      "action with the Japanese enemies. We boarded the ship at the Brooklyn Naval\n",
      "Yards. It was the T.M.S. Kungsholm. It was a luxury liner of the Swedish\n",
      "American Line. However they rechristened the ship when we boarded it to the\n",
      "9\n",
      "U.S.S. John Ericsson. We sailed down the east coast and zigzagged all the\n",
      "way down to the Panama Canal. We had naval escorts, destroyers and other\n",
      "naval ships with the convoy. We zigzagged to prevent a strike from enemy\n",
      "ships or planes and we entered the eastern entrance of the Panama Canal and\n",
      "then zigzagged across the Pacific Ocean to the area of the Tasmania Sea.\n",
      "During our course we had several alerts and Japanese dive bombers but\n",
      "fortunately we had no causalities.\n",
      "JZ: Was your convoy dive-bombed by the Japanese?\n",
      "EF: Oh yes. I recall a couple of these suicide bombers, similar to these goofballs\n",
      "in Iraq. They landed in the water right adjacent to the ships but fortunately\n",
      "they didn’t hit the ships at that time. They did at other times though.\n",
      "JZ: Were you in an anti-aircraft gun? Or you weren’t involved?\n",
      "EF: No, the navy personnel manned the guns on the ship. The Merchant Marine\n",
      "manned the other areas that needed to be taken care of. We were guards. We\n",
      "were guarding all the time to site any suspicious enemy activities. I was busy\n",
      "with different classes as we sailed across. I do remember that one Merchant\n",
      "Marine was killed but I don’t remember what happened but we buried him at\n",
      "sea.\n",
      "JZ: About a month you spent at sea from the Panama Canal.\n",
      "EF: It took us a month and seven days from Brooklyn to Melbourne, Australia.\n",
      "We entered the Tasmania Sea south of Australia and we encountered a\n",
      "typhoon, a horrible storm. The waves must have been a hundred feet high or\n",
      "so and it lifted some of the ships up in the air and you could see there\n",
      "propellers spinning in the air because they were so high out of the water. We\n",
      "finally landed in Melbourne, in southern Australia. The majority of our men\n",
      "10\n",
      "were very sick with dysentery, diarrhea, food poisonings, and sea sickness.\n",
      "The place was a horrible mess. They brought us to shore and the medical\n",
      "officers suggested that our men be housed in private homes in a small town\n",
      "north of Melbourne called Benigo, which was a gold mining town. We stayed\n",
      "in private homes for a couple of weeks to recuperate.\n",
      "JZ: So one serviceman per house?\n",
      "EF: Me and my buddy went to the same house. We went to a house of a widow\n",
      "by the name of Nancy Brown and her daughter Bess. They were beautiful\n",
      "people and they couldn’t do enough for us. They wrote to my fiancé and my\n",
      "mother and told them that I was okay. They had a very good friendship with\n",
      "my family. After spending a couple of weeks there we shipped out to New\n",
      "Caledonia. We landed at the bay of Noumea. New Caledonia was in French\n",
      "position.\n",
      "JZ: So who was charge of it? The French?\n",
      "EF: The French were in charge of the island, it’s a huge island. However a great\n",
      "many of them were pro-Nazi and didn’t like us at all. As a matter of fact,\n",
      "sometimes if we walked down the street they would come out and spit. They\n",
      "were very much against the American forces being there.\n",
      "JZ: Were these French military or governmental?\n",
      "EF: Civilians. However, there were some French military there. A lot of New\n",
      "Zealand and Australian military was there.\n",
      "JZ: Who was in charge of the island anyway? Was it occupied then?\n",
      "EF: It was the French government. We were over there as guests.\n",
      "11\n",
      "JZ: What did you do there?\n",
      "EF: We took our guns, our 90 millimeters and our .450 caliber machine guns, all\n",
      "our range equipment and electronic equipment and went to a little island\n",
      "called Ile Nou. It was similar to a Devil’s Island with a prison on it, it was a\n",
      "horrible place. We set our guns on top of a peek overlooking the city Noumea.\n",
      "JZ: That’s the capital, right?\n",
      "EF: Yes. And we guarded the bay because many of our naval vessels would go\n",
      "there to be serviced if they had damage and would need repair.\n",
      "JZ: Were Japanese forces fairly close to New Caledonia at this time?\n",
      "EF: The Japanese forces had moved to the northern section. Later on we moved\n",
      "from Ile Nou to a town in northern New Caledonia called Tontouta. In\n",
      "Tontouta we set up our guns so they could build another airstrip to the\n",
      "Solomon Islands where the Japanese were solidly embedded. They finally\n",
      "completed the strip and we were ordered to relieve the Marines at Guadalcanal\n",
      "in the Solomon Islands. We joined the Marines in the Solomons, where we\n",
      "saw a lot of air action and a lot of bombing. We were shelled. The Japanese\n",
      "were beaten back but they were still there even after we left the island.\n",
      "JZ: Really? So this is in the Solomons?\n",
      "EF: Yes. We spent quite awhile there. What does it say there?\n",
      "JZ: You went to Tontouta, New Caledonia in January 14, 1943 and then you went\n",
      "to sail for the Guadalcanal on May 23, 1943.\n",
      "12\n",
      "EF: Then the Marines left and our one gun battery joined the Marines because\n",
      "they were short an aircraft defense battery. We were told we were fortunate\n",
      "enough to be chosen to go with the Marines into Guadalcanal to make a\n",
      "landing there. An invasion there.\n",
      "JZ: The Guadalcanal is in the Solomons?\n",
      "EF: Yeah, we went to Bougainville, which is an island north of the Guadalcanal.\n",
      "Bougainville was a horrible experience.\n",
      "JZ: This was your first time in combat then?\n",
      "EF: No, well, we fired our guns many times before that, but this was the first time\n",
      "I ever made a landing under fire. The naval vessels blasted the shores before\n",
      "we landed. They put tons and tons of ammunition into the shores. Our planes\n",
      "dive bombed the area where the Japanese were concentrated. They beat the\n",
      "Japanese back quite a few. The Marines went ahead of our battery. After all\n",
      "this bombardment that took place they suffered heavy causalities and we came\n",
      "onto the beach to set up our guns they were bringing the bodies of Marines out\n",
      "on stretchers. They had stretchers tied to the sides of jeeps transporting the\n",
      "Marines to shore to have them evacuated on hospital ships. Quite a few\n",
      "Marines were wounded plus a lot of them were completely dead. I saw them.\n",

      "[Begin Tape 1, Side B]\n",
      "JZ: So when you were landed you were the second wave?\n",
      "EF: Yes. We went in behind the Marines.\n",
      "13\n",
      "JZ: Tell me about when you landed, you were in full gear?\n",
      "EF: That was in Luzon in the Philippines.\n",
      "JZ: You were brought to shore on?\n",
      "EF: On barges. In order to make the landing we would climb down the sides of the\n",
      "ships and fall onto the barges from rope ladders. They had rope netting\n",
      "hanging down from the sides of the ship. It was very difficult with the full\n",
      "pack and rifles and gas mask and whatever. With all that weight the climb\n",
      "down these nets and getting into the boat bobbing up and down furiously was\n",
      "not an easy thing to do.\n",
      "JZ: Did anybody ever fall?\n",
      "EF: Oh sure. Then we headed towards shore. We were given signals when it was\n",
      "proper time to head for shore. We would come into shore after the Marine\n",
      "boats had landed. We followed the Marines inward.\n",
      "JZ: And you had the 90 millimeter guns?\n",
      "EF: We had the 90 millimeter guns on certain barges and all our equipment.\n",
      "JZ: You brought them on shore?\n",
      "EF: Yes, we brought them on shore.\n",
      "JZ: And what? You had a tractor?\n",
      "EF: We had means of pulling each gun into position. In the mean time we had to\n",
      "use our rifles in case we had hand-to-hand combat. We had our bayonet fixed.\n",
      "14\n",
      "JZ: What kind of gun did you have?\n",
      "EF: I had an M-1 then, a Garand. I had a .45 side arm and a jungle knife.\n",
      "JZ: A jungle knife? What’s that?\n",
      "EF: I’ll show you.\n",
      "[Tape pauses]\n",
      "JZ: So a jungle knife, you got that off the natives?\n",
      "EF: Yes, they made them. Somewhere they got pieces of steel and I imagine it\n",
      "might be spring leaves. Like some of the old vehicles would have these\n",
      "springs with leaves bracketed together. I think they got the steel from them or\n",
      "I don’t know. They made a blade out of that. There was a lot of deer around\n",
      "and would get the deer antlers. The natives were still a lit bit uncivilized. A lot\n",
      "of the women didn’t wear clothing. On one occasion two officers and I went\n",
      "on a mission.\n",
      "[Interruption, Tape paused]\n",
      "JZ: So the military allowed you to have these knives?\n",
      "EF: Oh yeah, they encouraged it, especially when you were in combat. I was\n",
      "telling you about the natives. These two lieutenants and I went to hunt for a\n",
      "Japanese ammunition dump. We went through the jungle and we found it.\n",
      "There were a lot of things I would have liked to have as souvenirs but we were\n",
      "cautioned not to touch anything because a lot of things were booby-trapped.\n",
      "Consequently I didn’t get anything but I did get a helmet off of a dead Jap. As\n",
      "15\n",
      "we were going through this area we encountered a small village of natives and\n",
      "all the women were bare breasted. This one woman called, “Hey Joe, do you\n",
      "like bananas?” They called every G.I a “Joe.” I said, “Yeah, we like bananas.”\n",
      "So I went over and she gives me a big stalk of bananas and she tells me five\n",

      "guys that told our battery how fortunate we were to be chosen to go into\n",
      "Bougainville with the Marines. Why would anybody want to go into combat\n",
      "like that voluntarily without hesitation? We were supposed to be honored to\n",
      "go in with the Marines. This same lieutenant after we landed a few weeks is\n",
      "up with his hands around a palm tree. He’s trying to shake the palm, which is\n",
      "so big and heavy, screaming up at the tree, “Come down here you son of a\n",
      "bitch. Come down here.” He thought there was a sniper up in the tree. They\n",
      "took him away. I found out later on that they gave him a section eight, which\n",
      "was a medical discharge. But that’s the same guy that told us how lucky we\n",
      "were to be chosen.\n",

      "was a sniper up in the tree.\n",
      "JZ: Tell me about your combat experience when you were on Bougainville?\n",
      "EF: We first set up guns along the beach. The main purpose of our protection was\n",
      "to protect a stretch of land that they wanted to an air strip. So they brought in\n",
      "the Seabees, the Navy Construction Battalion, to build this air strip because\n",
      "the Japanese were shelling and bombing the heck out of us. The Seabees built\n",
      "the strip and at that time I had a radio station. I had a hole in the ground with\n",
      "sand bags all around it and I would contact other parts of my regiment that\n",
      "were on other islands. Dog Battery from the 70th was the only battery there at\n",
      "the time. The other batteries were all spread out throughout the other islands.\n",
      "In order to maintain contact with headquarters and the other officers we had to\n",
      "have a radio. I went to school and was trained. I had this radio station in a hole\n",
      "in the ground with sand bags all around it and I would keep our officers in\n",
      "contact with all the other officers in other parts. Well I set up radio and our\n",
      "guns in this place to protect this area. Every night the Japanese would come\n",
      "through with their bombers, their Mitsubishis, and they would blast the heck\n",
      "out of our area. You would just have to crawl into a fox hole or stay down in\n",
      "my hole. I would contact the other areas and tell them we were under attack\n",
      "and stuff like that. They would send messages to my officers and I would\n",

      "JZ: What does that mean?\n",
      "EF: Condition Black was your subject to be invaded by the enemy by sea.\n",
      "JZ: How big is this island? I am trying to get the scale of it. Fairly big?\n",
      "EF: I can’t tell you. It’s a big island.\n",
      "JZ: How long have you been there?\n",
      "EF: Well for thirty days we had been shelled by Japanese artillery from another\n",
      "island right off of where we were. They’re shooting shells and they’re landing\n",
      "all over us. So we had to spend a lot of time in the fox holes. At one time we\n",
      "had a 155 ammunition dump close by, right near where my radio station was.\n",
      "Well, they actually had a lot of duds. Their equipment was horrible, there\n",
      "tanks were junky, their guns were junky and a lot of there shells were duds. In\n",
      "one volley of artillery shells they hit the 155 ammunition dump. Consequently\n",
      "there was stuff flying everywhere. The only thing you can do is get down in\n",
      "the hole and pray. This other town I was telling you about was when we got\n",
      "the report that it was Condition Black. Someone in our intelligence sighted an\n",
      "invading Japanese force that was coming to make a landing. They told us to\n",
      "prepare for hand-to-hand combat and put our bayonets on your rifles. We all\n",
      "got into a fox hole and waited for them to come.\n",
      "JZ: Were we right near the beach then?\n",
      "18\n",
      "EF: Oh, right on the beach. We waited and waited and finally I got the radio\n",
      "report, all clear, and that they had been intercepted by our Navy. Right after\n",
      "that, Boom. A shell hit right in the middle of our kitchen tent and all our food\n",
      "was blown up. Even after that when we would open the can foods would still\n",
      "have scrapes in them afterwards. Well we finally got a plane to spot this\n",
      "Japanese artillery position. However, the plane’s radio was on a different\n",
      "frequency from what our radios were. So we couldn’t communicate with the\n",
      "plane and he couldn’t give us the information that we wanted. Accidentally I\n",
      "found a way of connecting a big wire spider directly into the antenna coil of\n",
      "my transmitter so I could speak to the man on the plane. He would give me\n",
      "correct information to fire at the position of the Japanese. This man in this\n",
      "small spotter plane would give me the coordinates or corrections to make in\n",
      "order to hit the target. So we shot so many smoke shells to get the position.\n",
      "Like I said, he would tell me the corrections to make and I would get on the\n",
      "telephone and tell the guns and the officers whether to move the guns and we\n",
      "finally knocked them out. There was a live volcano right beyond these\n",
      "Japanese. They must have hit the volcano because we got a little tremor, like\n",
      "an earthquake. It’s the first earthquake I have ever felt. We had jungle\n",
      "hammocks, which had mosquito netting and you would string them around\n",
      "two trees. A couple mornings after that I was in the jungle hammock sleeping\n",
      "and all of a sudden my hammock is moving. I get out and the ground is\n",
      "moving. I felt like I was drunk. They finally told me that it was another shock\n",
      "wave from the volcano that erupted. That was just an odd experience.\n",
      "JZ: Everyone would just sleep in these jungle hammocks and tie them around\n",
      "trees with netting around it. Is that comfortable?\n",
      "EF: Better then sleeping on the ground. All through maneuvers I would sleep on\n",
      "the ground and would wake up with frost all over you. Even in the Carolinas\n",
      "in would be freezing in the morning. A lot of things I don’t remember\n",
      "anymore. It’s over sixty years ago.\n",
      "19\n",
      "JZ: On June 18, 1943 there was a massive air attack of 120 Japanese aircraft.\n",
      "EF: That was in Guadalcanal.\n",
      "JZ: You participated in the Guadalcanal as well?\n",
      "EF: Yeah, that’s where we worked before Bougainville. We went up through the\n",
      "Solomons and then we went to Lae, New Guinea. Then we went to the\n",
      "Admiralty Islands and we went from there to launch our invasion on the\n",

      "JZ: Tell me about this attack then. You remember seeing all those dog fights on\n",
      "the Guadalcanal.\n",
      "EF: Oh it was frightening. There were so many planes up there shooting at each\n",
      "other. And we were ordered not to fire any guns in fear of hitting friendly\n",
      "planes. Another thing I might mention, we were able to identify an enemy\n",
      "plane or weather it was a friendly plane by a gadget that was called I.F.F. –\n",
      "Identification of Friend or Foe. This was an instrument that would send a\n",
      "secret signal that we were about to detect on our radars. The radars could tell\n",
      "if it was an enemy plane or a friendly plane because of this I.F.F. signal. If\n",
      "they didn’t show an I.F.F. signal we would shoot at them. When there was this\n",

      "The ammunition of these guns goes up to a certain area in the sky which is\n",
      "calculated by our computers of where that burst was going to be and a certain\n",
      "time and a certain position in the sky. We like to make a cluster of four bursts\n",
      "in that area of where the enemy planes were. We had four guns and the\n",
      "position of the guns on the ground is the position of where they would burst in\n",
      "the air. We had to stand by at the time and wait for a clear signal to fire but we\n",

      "all that detail. It’s boring enough as it is.\n",
      "JZ: Oh, I’m not bored. Did this come from your diary?\n",
      "EF: I have three diaries, three books. You need a microscope to see the writing\n",
      "it’s so small.\n",
      "JZ: Guadalcanal is another island as well. Did you have to land on Guadalcanal\n",
      "like on Bougainville?\n",
      "EF: No. Guadalcanal we pulled almost up to the land and got into boats and\n",
      "landed.\n",
      "JZ: What goes through your head? Was that your first time on combat?\n",
      "EF: I was scared a lot. When I’m in a hole there or in a gun placement and bombs\n",

      "It’s scary. Maybe I’m yellow, but it’s scary.\n",

      "JZ: Tell me about some other stories you have?\n",
      "EF: Well, I’ll tell you something about the people, the natives. In the Philippines\n",
      "they had some strange habits. A lot of the women would smoke cigarettes and\n",
      "would put the lit end of the cigarette into their mouth. I know it’s crazy. But\n",
      "they enjoyed the cigarette better if they have the lit end in their mouth. They\n",
      "would swallow the ashes.\n",
      "21\n",
      "The Philippines were very friendly. I made a friendship with a young boy,\n",
      "Ramon. He would come to my tent. Oh, by the way it rains a lot in\n",
      "Philippines. We had to build walk-ways between tents out of bamboo. There\n",
      "are huge forests of bamboo there. The natives make everything out of\n",
      "bamboo, including there homes. This is outside of the cities. They had\n",
      "bamboo homes up on stilts because of the amount of rain. They would have\n",
      "chickens and pigs running around under the houses. Anyway, this young boy,\n",
      "Ramon, took a liking of me. He wanted me to meet his family. I told him the\n",
      "next time I was free to go out and got a pass, I would go to his village with\n",
      "him. So my day off I went with him and he took me down to a river where he\n",
      "had a canoe. I got in and he paddled that canoe with one paddle. I don’t know\n",
      "how he did it because I tried it and I couldn’t keep it straight. We went down\n",
      "this river through the jungle and every time we pass another canoe from the\n",
      "opposite direction they would talk. They would ask each other where they\n",
      "were going. What I didn’t understand was that it was a friendly greeting to ask\n",
      "where you were going and not that they were minding your business. Anyway,\n",
      "we got into his village and he took me to his home was which was big bamboo\n",
      "shack on stilts. And down below the shack was a big circle of women weaving\n",
      "palm leaves. They were a very wide leaf. They were weaving them to make\n",
      "roof shingles. They weave them and tie them with bamboo string onto the\n",
      "roofs. This group gets together and makes them to make some money. They\n",
      "wanted to know who I was and he explained. I did have my small rifle with\n",
      "me, so they wanted to know why I had it on me. I told them I was ordered to\n",
      "carry it with me wherever I go. And they all saluted me. He took me into his\n",
      "house to meet his mother and they were all singing outside in the circle. His\n",
      "mother was a little, old woman. He took her hand and took her hand to his\n",
      "forehead and bowed. I asked what that was and he told me it was a Filipino\n",
      "tradition. I took her hand and did the same thing and she was very much\n",
      "moved. He told her son that I must stay for supper. Boy, I was sorry I ever\n",
      "agreed. They had some kind of stuff made out of raw coconut and a vegetable\n",
      "like turnips. They kept telling me it was very good and I must try. And not to\n",
      "22\n",
      "insult them I ate all of it. The raw coconut was real sweet and I didn’t like it at\n",
      "all. He gave me this vegetable and I took a bite and forced myself to eat it. All\n",
      "of a sudden I started to feel itchy and I broke into hives. I said thank you very\n",
      "much and that it was very good but I couldn’t endanger my life anymore.\n",
      "Quite a few things like that did occur. Some of those Pilipino were very\n",
      "talented and very good artists and painters. They would make trays that they\n",
      "would weave out of thin bamboo and paint scenes on them. I had some of\n",
      "them but they deteriorated and I threw them away.\n",
      "JZ: Were they much different from the native people in the Solomons?\n",
      "EF: Actually the natives in the Solomons were the pure natives, they were black.\n",
      "And they were bushmen. They weren’t too well civilized, however, the French\n",
      "people, the white people, were very well civilized. They had what they called\n",
      "their stores, very old-fashioned. Same way in the Philippines, they were very\n",
      "much behind the times judging by American standards. However, in Manilla I\n",
      "encountered a lot of Spanish people because the Philippines were once owned\n",
      "by the Spanish until the United States took it over from Spain in the Spanish\n",

      "women for four years they looked gorgeous to me. I tried to behave myself. I\n",
      "went to Mass in a cathedral in Manilla on Easter Sunday and it was very\n",
      "impressive. The Catholic Philippines were very devoted. It was a very nice\n",
      "Easter Mass but I missed my honey and my home. I never got over being\n",
      "homesick all the time.\n",
      "JZ: I’m always curious, because you were Italian American did you ethnicity ever\n",
      "come up with any in military?\n",
      "EF: No, because several of my buddies were Italian Americans. I was the only one\n",
      "from Pittsburgh. There were some from Wilksburg and eastern Pennsylvania\n",
      "23\n",
      "but there were Italians from New Jersey, New York, Long Island and one\n",
      "Italian was from New Orleans, Louisiana. Most of them were from New York\n",
      "and that area and New Jersey. But I never had any difficulty with the fact that\n",
      "I was Italian especially because I made sergeant so I got a little more respect.\n",
      "However, I was inducted into our regular army outfit. These were all men that\n",
      "volunteered and signed our regular enlistment. They were very envious of the\n",
      "draftees that came in and especially if a draftee was promoted they raised all\n",
      "kinds of hell. When I got my PFC and eventually my sergeant rating they\n",
      "were really burning up. They would say, “We’re career soldiers, we signed up\n",
      "for a three year term.” But I was in there for over three years. They were\n",
      "enlisted men and consequently they didn’t want draftees in this particular\n",
      "group. Most of these men were Tennessee hillbillies. They all loved\n",
      "moonshine and no matter where they went they would find a still, a\n",
      "bootlegger.\n",
      "JZ: Okay.\n",
      "EF: And they would buy white lightening and would be drunk. And when we got\n",
      "to the Solomons they did the same thing. Some of the natives made wine\n",
      "called Neepa and they would always manage to get a hold of a lot of Neepa.\n",
      "JZ: So you made sergeant when you were in the states?\n",
      "EF: No. I made sergeant overseas. I made PFC in transit. I don’t remember if I\n",
      "`made PFC in Baltimore or after I was on the ship. I can’t remember that. But\n",
      "I did make sergeant in New Caledonia. I was buck sergeant for a while.\n",
      "JZ: What does that mean if you’re buck sergeant?\n",
      "EF: Buck sergeant has three stripes and then I was made a technician sergeant.\n",
      "That’s three stripes with a T. It’s the same pay.\n",
      "24\n",
      "JZ: What was your pay?\n",
      "\\\n",
      "EF: You want to know what I made when I went into the army?\n",
      "JZ: Yeah.\n",
      "EF: Fifteen dollars a month. That was my pay. Wait a minute, twenty-one dollars a\n",
      "month.\n",
      "JZ: That’s as a PFC?\n",
      "EF: I made twenty-one dollars as a private. I don’t know what I made as a PFC.\n",
      "Twenty-one dollars when I was inducted. It wasn’t much later on, you never\n",
      "got much. I always had it sent home to my parents. I had no need for money.\n",
      "JZ: Did anybody keep the money? You couldn’t use it.\n",
      "EF: Oh yeah. Like in Noumea they had a place to go buy a candy bar or something\n",
      "like that. Maybe I would save a buck out of my allotment. Instead of sending\n",
      "the whole amount I would go and buy a few candy bars. We got free\n",
      "cigarettes.\n",
      "JZ: Did you smoke?\n",
      "EF: I smoked like crazy. Thank God I had sense enough to quit once I got back to\n",

      "JZ: Tell me about you in the army and you being put with the Marines. Was there\n",
      "any conflict there because you were in the army?\n",
      "EF: No, just that one operation.\n",
      "JZ: And that was in Bougainville.\n",
      "EF: Yeah, just that one operation because they were short a gun battery.\n",
      "JZ: You had pretty much cleared the Japanese out?\n",
      "EF: Well no, when we left there were a lot of Japanese back in the mountains.\n",
      "JZ: Tell me about your job, you were with the radio now?\n",
      "EF: I started out in basic training as a gunner then I was on the machine gun for\n",
      "awhile. I was on everything. I was on the 90 millimeter gun crew. I was on the\n",
      "radar. I was an observer at various times, a perimeter observer watching\n",
      "enemy movements. Then I went to radio school and they sent me a big\n",
      "transmitter out and I took over the transmitter. Ninety percent of the time after\n",
      "that I was radio man by myself. I did give classes sometimes on radio just so\n",
      "they would understand how it works in case something happened to me. Other\n",
      "than that I was strictly radio operator. Of course I had all kinds of combat\n",
      "training and rifle training.\n",
      "JZ: So most of the time there were 155s or did you use the 90 millimeter?\n",
      "EF: We only used the 155s at Fort Eustis at basic training for three months. Then\n",
      "we went to 90 millimeters and anti-aircraft.\n",
      "26\n",
      "JZ: So most of the times on the island were you firing against enemy aircraft?\n",
      "EF: Oh yeah. We would fire against enemy aircraft and sometimes we would be\n",
      "getting bombed. I would give corrections on the telephone and I would be in\n",
      "contact with the other batteries on different islands and we would always\n",
      "shoot at the same area. My commanding officer would stand by my side and I\n",
      "would tell him everything I heard on phone or on the earphones or on the\n",
      "radio.\n",
      "JZ: Can you fire a 90 millimeter on land?\n",
      "EF: Oh yes.\n",
      "JZ: You can use them on both?\n",
      "EF: We could use them for anti-tank or enemy positions. We had different kinds\n",
      "of ammunition for those things.\n",
      "JZ: Oh, different ammunition.\n",
      "EF: The Japanese had a different kind too. When I was in there they attacked us on\n",
      "Bougainville and they would drop what they called Daisy-cutters. These\n",
      "bombs were anti-personnel and when they hit the ground they would give a\n",
      "big burst of shrapnel. The shrapnel would fly all over the place. I woke up in\n",
      "the morning sometimes after an attack and when I went outside there were\n",
      "pieces all over the place.\n",
      "JZ: What did they look like? Just pieces of metal?\n",
      "EF: Jagged metal. Chunks of metal, steel or whatever. They would be shattered all\n",
      "over the place. They called them Daisy-cutters.\n",
      "27\n",
      "JZ: I’ve heard of them.\n",
      "EF: They’re anti-personnel. One thing I forgot to mention, on November 10, 1943\n",
      "to December 12, 1944 we endured constant daily and nightly bombing and\n",
      "shelling attacks. The island of Bougainville was not yet secured by allied\n",
      "forces. 24,000 Japanese troops still occupied much of the island when Dog\n",
      "Battery prepared to advance to New Guinea.\n",
      "JZ: So you were there for a year?\n",
      "EF: Yeah. Well, right. And Dog Battery boarded the U.S.S. Sheridan, ready to sail\n",
      "to New Guinea. When we got to New Guinea we landed at Lae. We came up\n",
      "the beach in Lae and four days later we got back on the ship again and left\n",
      "New Guinea and landed on Manus Island in the Admiralty Island Group. The\n",
      "reason we went to this Manus Island was because they had a dry dock there\n",
      "and the U.S.S. Sheridan could not keep up with the convoy. So what they did\n",
      "was bring the Sheridan into a dry dock, which is a huge bracket that a ship sits\n",
      "on and they drain the water out so the whole bottom of the ship is exposed.\n",
      "They ordered all the men on out ship, every man had to get off the ship and go\n",
      "down under the ship with brushes and scrapers and scrap the bottom of that\n",
      "ship. Scrap the barnacles off the ship because the barnacles were the reason\n",
      "the ship couldn’t go fast enough.\n",
      "JZ: What are barnacles?\n",
      "EF: Barnacles are shell fish that attach themselves to everything underwater.\n",
      "There like little cones. This is a baby barnacle. The ship was completely\n",
      "covered, every inch of the ship.\n",
      "JZ: Boy, a little thing like that can slow it down.\n",
      "28\n",
      "EF: Well yeah, because there are millions of them.\n",
      "JZ: Of course your job was to?\n",
      "EF: We were all given scrapers and long handled brooms. Even the officers were\n",
      "down there. I was alongside the brass scraping and I made a friend from my\n",
      "home town. He was an officer in the Navy. His name was Unitas, Jerry Unitas\n",
      "from my home town. He was the cousin of Johnny Unitas that played for the\n",
      "Baltimore Colts. So when we got back on the ship we prepared to make our\n",
      "landing on Luzon. It was around Christmas time.\n",
      "JZ: December 20, 1944.\n",
      "EF: December 20, 1944 preparations were made to invade the Philippines. We\n",
      "weighted anchor toward Leyte Island in the Philippines. However, Christmas\n",
      "occurred when we were on that ship as you can see by my dates here. The\n",
      "Navy had brought a ship load of Christmas presents for the navy men, this\n",
      "was a Navy ship. So this Jerry Oneidas, this officer, they had a beautiful set up\n",
      "for them. We were down in the moldy hole in our bunk beds. They had the\n",
      "beautiful suite upstairs for the officers. So he came down and looked me up.\n",
      "He found me down in the hole and took me up to the officer quarters for the\n",
      "Christmas party. Those lucky guys had all kinds of good stuff to eat and I was\n",
      "eating garbage. And they opened Christmas presents. He said, “Look Eugene.\n",
      "Look what I got here.” He opened a box and got a real fancy tie. He says,\n",
      "“Now what in the Hell am I going to do with this?” He’s dead now. Whether\n",
      "he died in combat I don’t know but he’s gone. But he was good enough to\n",
      "come down and look me up. He was a neighbor of mine. So we went to the\n",
      "Philippines and like I said we landed in the water. We thought we were going\n",
      "to Leyte and Mindanao. However we past the islands of Mindanao and Leyte\n",
      "and we pulled a sneak attack from the absolute northern piece of Luzon,\n",
      "29\n",
      "which is on the Lingayan Gulf. We came in the Lingayan Gulf and the landing\n",
      "craft was unable to proceed all the way to the beach compelling us members\n",
      "of Dog Battery to disembark into nearly four feet of water and to wade to\n",
      "shore. With full packs on our backs, full ammunition belts, loaded rifles with\n",
      "bayonets fixed and gas masks.\n",
      "JZ: Were you under fire at this time?\n",
      "EF: Fortunately the infantry had beaten the Japanese back far enough that we\n",
      "could land peacefully. The infantry was ahead of us and they had pushed the\n",
      "Japanese back enough so we didn’t have to land under fire. We were very\n",
      "fortunate. We followed them all the way down towards Manilla.\n",
      "JZ: And during this time was this all jungle?\n",
      "EF: No, there’s Barrios here and there. Little towns. They called them Barrios.\n",
      "JZ: So with your 90 millimeter guns were you firing them into enemy aircraft?\n",
      "EF: Oh yes.\n",
      "JZ: So there were aircraft the Japanese still had in operation?\n",
      "EF: Oh yes. They were getting pushed back though, pushed south. We landed on\n",

      "you supporting the infantry as well?\n",
      "EF: Oh yes.\n",
      "30\n",
      "JZ: The 155s and other guys like that would help the infantry directly.\n",
      "EF: Yeah, they would fire inland over their heads. They would try to wipe them\n",
      "out before the infantry or Marines gets there. They do the best they can but\n",
      "there not a hundred percent. They suffer a lot of causalities.\n",
      "JZ: Was MacArthur there with you? Would he land there?\n",
      "EF: No. He landed later on.\n",

      "water up to his ankles. Maybe not that high. Just covering his shoes. When he\n",
      "left the Philippines when the Japanese invaded he said, “I will return.” That\n",
      "was a famous statement he made. Well, when he landed and so called waded\n",
      "ashore he said, “I have returned.” At the funerals I have used that statement in\n",
      "prayers. I say, “My commander, General Douglas MacArthur once said, ‘Old\n",
      "soldiers never die.’” That’s one of my closing statements in one of my prayers\n",
      "that I say.\n",
      "JZ: I’ve heard that. Does he say something else after that? Or is that it? That’s the\n",
      "saying?\n",
      "EF: Well that’s not the whole statement. “Old soldiers never die, they just fade\n",
      "away.” But I don’t put that on there because I’m standing in front coffin of a\n",
      "dead soldier or dead sailor. Well, I only say it for soldiers and Marines. I say\n",
      "something else for sailors.\n",
      "31\n",
      "JZ: What did you think of MacArthur? He was your commanding general. A lot\n",
      "of people say he’s very conversional.\n",
      "EF: I didn’t have much of any kind of feeling for him. I didn’t have any\n",
      "association with him. All I know is that he was ahead of what they called the\n",
      "Americal 23rd Division.\n",
      "JZ: And what is that, Americal? Why did they call it that?\n",
      "EF: I don’t know, that’s what they just named it. I was a member of the Americal\n",
      "Division 70th Coast Guard Artillery Anti-Aircraft Regiment.\n",
      "JZ: Was that maybe because Australians served with you? Americal?\n",
      "EF: I don’t know where they derived the name from. All I know was that it was\n",
      "called the Americal Division. He had his headquarters in Australia for a long\n",
      "time.\n",
      "JZ: Tell me about the Japanese soldiers? I don’t know if you had any close\n",
      "contact.\n",
      "EF: I didn’t have any close contact except prisoners sometimes. My feelings\n",
      "towards war in general, I’m very much against war. There’s nothing beautiful\n",
      "about war. War is just legalized murder and you’re just out there to kill\n",
      "somebody. And your enemy is in the same boat you’re in. He’s put there\n",
      "because he has to be there. He’s forced to be there and I’m forced to be there\n",
      "and we’re both forced to kill each other. But for protection you have to defend\n",
      "yourself. Protect your own life. That’s the only reason you have to kill, to\n",
      "protect your own life is the way I feel. There’s nothing glorious or glamorous\n",
      "about war. That’s my personal feelings and some people may object to me\n",
      "saying that. There’s not one thing that’s glorious or glamorous about war and\n",
      "32\n",
      "I’ll stick to that until my dying day. I still think that they ought to bring our\n",
      "people home from Iraq as soon as possible.\n",
      "JZ: When you got down to Manilla, what was it like there?\n",
      "EF: Manilla was a thriving city. However, the Philippines are very enterprising\n",
      "people, they had stores and restaurants and loads of prostitutes. There were\n",
      "devout Christians that I encountered. A lot of them were very good people and\n",
      "trustworthy people. There are some I wouldn’t trust but majority of them were\n",
      "nice people. The one thing about the kids, I enjoy kids, they were so cute.\n",
      "They would study hard and English was their second language. They liked to\n",
      "speak to you in English and they wanted you to speak to them in English.\n",
      "They do pretty well. They don’t have a Toys ‘R Us stores there. So the kids\n",
      "would enjoy themselves by catching a cricket and tying string together to\n",
      "make the crickets do tricks. They were real cute. I enjoyed the school kids. I\n",
      "went to several of the schools and talked to some of the teachers, they were\n",
      "dedicated teachers.\n",
      "JZ: This was after the Japanese surrendered?\n",
      "EF: Well no. They didn’t surrender until I was discharged. I was back in the\n",
      "United States when surrendered. I was on my honeymoon when they\n",
      "surrendered, I was in Atlantic City.\n",
      "JZ: So you ended your service in the Philippines.\n",
      "EF: We had what was called the point system. You got so many points each month\n",
      "you were overseas. You got points for different things. I don’t remember what\n",
      "the points were for. I had accumulated enough points to discharge ten people\n",
      "being overseas all that time.\n",
      "33\n",
      "JZ: Right, you got drafted before the war even started.\n",
      "EF: When I was told that I was going to go home I was jumping with joy because\n",
      "the war wasn’t over yet. I hated to leave some of my buddies because I made\n",
      "real close friends with some of them. Some of them cried and some of the\n",
      "little Philippine kids cried when I got onto the truck to go to Manilla. You see,\n",
      "we were still up north in Binmalley, a small Barrio. I got onto the truck and I\n",
      "can still see a particular little boy crying because I was leaving. A good friend\n",
      "of mine, a staff sergeant from Wilmington, Delaware he also shed a tear. I\n",
      "said, “I wish you could go with me.” He said, “Yeah, so do I. When you get\n",
      "back give my wife a call and tell her that I’m okay.” His wife Katie. We\n",
      "would visit each other quite often in Wilmington. He became real wealthy by\n",
      "the way.Anyhow, I boarded an Air Force C54. A great big Air Force\n",
      "Transport at Nichols Field in Manilla and made hops all the way across the\n",
      "Pacific. We landed at Guam, Kwagalen Island, Johnson Island and finally the\n",
      "Hawaiian Islands at Hickam Field. On June 23, 1945 I landed at Hickam\n",
      "Field from the north. Then I boarded a plane and touched down at Hamilton\n",
      "Field, San Francisco after landing on all those islands.\n",
      "JZ: I bet you were so happy to be back on American soil.\n",
      "EF: So then I was in charge of ten fellows that were up for discharge with me and\n",
      "I had to see that they got onto the train. We rode the train all the way to\n",
      "Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania.\n",
      "JZ: So you probably passed through Pittsburgh?\n",
      "EF: Yes.\n",
      "JZ: I bet you wanted to stop in Pittsburgh?\n",
      "34\n",
      "EF: That hurt. Yeah so I got to Indiantown Gap and I got my Honor Discharge.\n",
      "JZ: I’m curious. In the Philippines did you hear anything about the soldiers that\n",
      "had been captured and tanned? Did you hear anything about it?\n",
      "EF: I didn’t hear any details but I knew about it. It was horrible what those men went\n",
      "through.\n",
      "JZ: Did you hear any of the stories when they found them in the prison camps\n",
      "after they were liberated?\n",
      "EF: I heard mouth to mouth. I heard stories about how they were abused and how\n",
      "they suffered and everything. It was really moving to me. I felt so badly about\n",
      "those poor guys. It was horrible what those guys went through. That’s another\n",
      "reason why these guys in Iraq are not having a picnic. But you hear their\n",
      "wives say that they’re going to have to be there for another month. What’s a\n",
      "month compared to four years plus?\n",
      "JZ: Your generation served four years, five years of war.\n",
      "EF: A lot of my guys didn’t come back. A lot of them lost their lives. I was lucky.\n",
      "Like I say, those bombs have no respect for anybody. Fortunately, God was\n",
      "with me and brought me back safe and sane. I did have a form of fever. It has\n",
      "symptoms of malaria. However, it isn’t as permanent as malaria. I had nausea\n",
      "and stomach pains and diarrhea at times but I survived.\n",
      "JZ: Did you receive any awards or medals?\n",
      "EF: Just my regular medals and they’re over there in that room. Anyhow, we were\n",
      "compelled to take salt pills every day and a pill called Atabrian which was to\n",
      "prevent the occurrence of malaria. It makes your complexion a little yellow\n",
      "35\n",
      "and makes your urine yellow. But we were compelled to take them both every\n",
      "day. The salt pill was because of perspiration.\n",
      "JZ: Would that make you perspire?\n",
      "EF: Well, it prevented you from having heat exhaustion.\n",
      "JZ: Of course it was always hot.\n",
      "EF: It was the jungle. It was hot, very hot. I received the American Defense\n",
      "Medal. I received the South Pacific Campaign Medal. I received the Good\n",
      "Conduct Medal. I got six medals. I got the Philippine Liberation Medal. I got\n",
      "two Philippine medals. I have to look. I can’t remember.\n",
      "JZ: When you came home, I’m curious to know, there wasn’t much excitement\n",
      "when many soldiers came home, no parades.\n",
      "EF: No Vietnam. Well, not when I came home.\n",
      "JZ: Of course the war wasn’t over. Well it was in Europe.\n",
      "EF: Well, right.\n",
      "JZ: How do you think the war affected you?\n",
      "EF: Well, I can’t help feel that I lost over four years of my life. I mean I’m not real\n",
      "happy that I did it. I don’t think it was such a great thing. I was drafted, I\n",
      "didn’t volunteer. Maybe if I volunteered I would feel different. Like I said, I\n",
      "hate war. Just like Roosevelt would say, “I hate war.” But at the same time he\n",
      "sent all us guys overseas to fight. Anyhow, you got to do what you got to do.\n",
      "Its Gods will and God took care of me, thank God. It could have been a lot\n",
      "36\n",
      "worse. I saw a lot of guys. It could have been a lot worse. I go to the Vet’s\n",
      "hospital and see these guys, they’re still suffering from it.\n",
      "JZ: Tell me about how you got involved with the VFW and now you’re a Chaplin.\n",
      "EF: Well when I was overseas I got a letter from the VFW from the post in Mount\n",
      "Alder, PA. They suggested that since I was overseas I was eligible to become\n",
      "member of the Veterans for Wars. So I joined at that time. When I was\n",
      "discharged and I came back they were located close to my home. I thought\n",
      "maybe I’ll be an active member. However, the first communication that I\n",
      "received from that post was that the next meeting will be whenever and bring\n",
      "a hammer so we can build our stands for our carnival. They never said a word\n",
      "of welcome home after being over there all that time. Nothing. Bring a\n",
      "hammer. So I thought, the heck with this. Then, later on, I was approached to\n",
      "rejoin by the American Legion in Bethel Park. I handed in my applications\n",
      "and they wasted time and acted like they were interested so I said forget this.\n",
      "Then this outfit, Library, where I’m at now approached me. These people are\n",
      "all old miners and farmers and they approached me to join. They said just\n",
      "come out and look over the place. I went out and they made a big fuss over\n",
      "me. They were so nice to me I couldn’t resist. Well, after I joined, they\n",
      "conned me into being Chairman of the Board, Board of Directors, Trustee,\n",
      "and do this and do that. Another fellow and I, he fought in Europe and was a\n",
      "disabled veteran talked me into going to the schools and give talks on\n",
      "Patriotism. So I finally agreed and we started that program. We were\n",
      "appreciated very much and complimented a lot. And as a matter of fact some\n",
      "of the kids sent me wonderful letters for thanking me for coming to their\n",
      "school and talking about our government and the flag. These letters are so cute\n",
      "and beautiful. After that, I was approached by the South Hills Military Honor\n",
      "Guard Society. They needed a Chaplin. At the mean time I was assistant\n",
      "Chaplin at Library. We have essay contests for the kids and award the kids\n",
      "saving bonds and have dinners for them. I’m involved in all that stuff and\n",
      "37\n",
      "going to the schools and talking to the kids. It’s time consuming and I’m tired\n",
      "of it but no one wants to take over my job. It’s so much work for me. Since\n",
      "my darling wife is gone I have a whole six room house to take care of and\n",
      "cooking. Plus the fact that I take the minutes of every meeting and have to\n",
      "transcribe them and type them out and read them at the next meeting. The\n",
      "young people don’t want to do it anymore. I’m trying to get rid of this job\n",
      "very soon. We have participated in about a hundred funerals within the past\n",
      "year, military funerals. What we do there is have a twenty-one gun salute. We\n",
      "have seven rifle men that give the twenty-one gun salute. After the clergy man\n",
      "speaks I say two prayers and give the command for the firing squad to\n",
      "commence shooting. Then the bulgier plays taps. Then two representatives\n",
      "from each branch of the service fold the flag that drapes the coffin. During the\n",
      "course of folding the flag I give another talk about the representation of three\n",
      "spent rifle shells and tell them what they represent and then I insert them into\n",
      "the flag as they’re folded. The highest ranking man from the forces presents\n",
      "the flag to the survivors of the veteran. That’s the procedure we follow in a\n",
      "military funeral. That’s it.\n",
      "JZ: Unfortunately you’ve been doing a lot of funerals.\n",
      "EF: Yes. Particularly World War II veterans. Sometimes we have two funerals in a\n",
      "day back to back. We have to do one funeral and hurry across town to do\n",
      "another. It’s quite moving. I have little prayers that I have printed on cards\n",
      "that if I see anyone weeping at the funeral, after the funeral I offer my\n",
      "condolences and give them one of these little prayers. A lot of people have\n",
      "called me and written thank you notes for having done this. I watch to see who\n",
      "are most affected by the death of the veterans.\n",
      "JZ: Anything else you want to say?\n",
      "EF: No, I think I beat your ears to a pulp.\n",
      "38\n",
      "JZ: I just to say, you’ve served your country and you continue to do wonderful\n",
      "things today.\n",
      "EF: I’m trying.\n",
      "JZ: No, you’re doing. I hope through these interviews like you say, “Old soldiers\n",

      "FG: I arrived in New York on October 28, 1937. We sailed from Naples on the twenty-first of\n",
      "October. In seven days we were in New York.\n",
      "JZ: Where is your family from in Italy?\n",

      "FG: My father came here. My father left Europe when he was fifteen years old. In 1903, he\n",
      "came to New York, from New York to Pittsburgh in 1903. He was a single boy. Then he\n",
      "came home in 1911 and he married my mother.\n",
      "JZ: What did he do in New York?\n",
      "FG: He came to New York in a ship. In the ship they used to carry animals, so he worked\n",
      "there and got free passes. He was a little young boy then. But when he came here he had\n",
      "different jobs. He worked for the city, state, Pittsburgh railway and in the greenhouse. He\n",

      "JZ: What do you remember about your childhood in Italy?\n",
      "FG: Well I’ll tell you it was a depressing time. In my little town you could make a living\n",
      "doing odd jobs. I learned to be a tailor when I was nine years old. I tailored and barbered\n",
      "at the same time. When I was twelve years old I had my own customers. I used to go out\n",
      "to the farms and would take care of those farmer boys and girls. I made a living out of\n",
      "that. No money but they used to give me food, that’s all I wanted. My family and the man\n",
      "that taught me how to become a barber just wanted to eat. No money involved. When I\n",
      "was fifteen I used to make suits but at that time they wouldn’t pay me, they would pay\n",

      "JZ: What instrument?\n",

      "JZ: I’m curious. Did your father serve in the Italian Army?\n",
      "FG: No, he was underage. He left when he was only fifteen years old. I was the only one that\n",
      "was in the army and my kid brother too.\n",
      "JZ: When you were growing up at this time, Mussolini was in power. Can you tell me [about\n",
      "him]?\n",
      "FG: The beginning Mussolini was a gentleman. He was a good one. My home town had no\n",
      "electricity, no water, and the streets were all dirt. When Mussolini came into power he\n",
      "got electricity, sewers and the streets paved. Before, everyone was illiterate. But\n",
      "Mussolini came in and said, “You send your son and daughter school or else.” Then\n",
      "everyone started to learn. But then when I was fifteen they drafted me. We used to go up\n",
      "in the mountain for one month for training in the summertime. When I got in the army\n",
      "here, I knew how to shoot the gun better than some of the sergeants because we were\n",
      "taught as young kids. They taught how to shoot the machine gun, how to go up in the\n",
      "mountain and read the compass.\n",
      "JZ: Did you go to school too and learn to be trained?\n",
      "FG: I went to school then to be a priest. As a matter of fact in my mother’s family, there were\n",
      "four priests. My mother was a very religious woman. My mother said, “Son, we got to\n",
      "pay the bills.” I said to her, “Let me get my pencil.” And she asked me, “What the Hell\n",
      "do you need a pencil for?” Back then it was fourteen dollars. She had a good memory.\n",
      "Finally we taught her to write her own name. She was extremely intelligent. My father\n",

      "JZ: Why did you decide to come to the United States? To be with your father?\n",
      "FG: No, for a better life. See, I came first. The second year my father said that he had to go\n",

      "there? Make up your mind.” What I did was go to immigrations downtown to a young\n",

      "JZ: How was it at Ellis Island?\n",
      "FG: I didn’t go. I was an American born abroad. I was an American citizen since I was born.\n",

      "that when your first child was born they would ask you if you wanted them to be an\n",
      "American citizen. But he never told them that he had a daughter. So my sister never came\n",

      "1923 that no matter how many children you have they became an American citizen with\n",
      "you. When I was in the Army here they asked me if I was an American citizen. I said that\n",
      "I wasn’t. They had to find out. Oh a week or so later they called me a damn liar. I came to\n",
      "the Army with an Italian passport. I didn’t know.\n",
      "JZ: Oh, because your father was American, you were American. Did your father have to give\n",
      "up his Italian citizenship?\n",
      "FG: No.\n",

      "FG: The best job that he liked, he was working in the greenhouse. He loved that. He also\n",
      "worked at the steel mill and with the Pittsburgh Street Car Company.\n",
      "JZ: What did you do when you came?\n",
      "FG: I was a tailor.\n",
      "JZ: Oh, so you were tailoring?\n",
      "FG: Yeah all my life.\n",
      "JZ: Where did you find work? In East Liberty?\n",
      "FG: Believe it or not I worked for a dollar a day, nine hours a day for six months. Here in East\n",
      "Liberty. Do you know where the railroad station was? It was all shops there on the\n",
      "second floor. They had a big tailor shop there. They put me as an apprentice because they\n",
      "didn’t want to pay me the full price. But I knew how to do it on a different system. Big\n",
      "deal. But you got to make a living. What happened to me, the guy with the shop got sick\n",
      "and almost died. From there, I went to work at the William Penn Hotel downtown. I went\n",
      "from seven dollars a week to fifteen dollars a week. What’s the difference between the\n",
      "two places? One place was a union and the other wasn’t with a union. I was supposed to\n",
      "make eighteen dollars a week but got fifteen because of the union. In those days that was\n",
      "great money. We had a good season and a bad season. You were lucky if you worked\n",
      "nine months out of the year because of the Depression. They liked me over there. I was\n",
      "good to them. When you’re good and give respect to them, they like it. At the end of the\n",
      "week I would make about five or six dollars extra from tips.\n",
      "JZ: Did your dad own a house?\n",
      "FG: No. We bought a house after the war. We bought four houses. The whole building, all\n",
      "four units.\n",
      "JZ: When you were here during the Depression did you miss Italy?\n",
      "5\n",
      "FG: Yes and no. You kind of forget it. But either way I liked my little town.\n",
      "JZ: In Italy did they ever tell you bad things about the United States or any propaganda?\n",
      "FG: What they taught us was to be a good, respectful person and obey the laws and no one\n",
      "would bother you. Most of all respect the people. That was a Mussolini idea.\n",
      "JZ: Did you have any difficulty with the government, the Fascist government?\n",
      "FG: No, not really. They would treat us nice. When we would play in the band at school we\n",
      "used to sing the Morning Prayer.\n",
      "JZ: By the time the war started in 1941, were you still a tailor?\n",
      "FG: Yeah, all the time.\n",
      "JZ: And you played in a band too here?\n",
      "FG: No, not in a band. See in 1941 I missed the draft. Then in 1942 they got me in the end. In\n",
      "1943 I went into the Army and came out in 1946. I had a little bit of a hard time when I\n",
      "went over there because my English wasn’t that good. I learned a lot.\n",
      "JZ: Did you ever take classes?\n",
      "FG: Well I learned to speak English at the Kingsley House. I can understand a little bit of\n",
      "French. They put me in school with the black students. There were about ten of them.\n",
      "They were all middle aged and they would look at me like I was one of them. I started to\n",
      "like them. Then again, I learned it good when I went into the Army.\n",
      "JZ: When Pearl Harbor happened and Italy declared war against the United States what did\n",
      "you think?\n",
      "6\n",
      "FG: I didn’t believe it. It was Sunday morning and I was still in bed when I heard it on the\n",
      "radio. When Mussolini declared war against the United States people started to turn\n",
      "against him. Not just me but everyone in my same position. When you declare war\n",
      "against the United States, what chance do you have? Let me tell you about when you\n",
      "went into the Army. This you’re going to like. Take a guess where they send me? I\n",
      "started in York at a camp to learn the Italian language. There was a young boy from\n",
      "Philadelphia there and he taught me English and I taught him Italian. I was supposed to\n",
      "go to Italy for a G-5 to deal with the civilians. I went into the infantry.\n",
      "JZ: In 1943 you were drafted and right afterwards you went to York.\n",
      "FG: They kept me there for fourteen days. There were two Italians and one German.\n",
      "JZ: Did you face any discrimination because you were Italian?\n",
      "FG: Oh, here they treated me very well. They respected me. I didn’t understand the way they\n",
      "spoke to me because they spoke differently than we did. When I went to war overseas, in\n",
      "England I had a nurse. She was American from North Carolina. My doctor was from\n",
      "Pennsylvania. So I said to the doctor that I didn’t feel like getting up because I had got\n",
      "hurt in war and suffered from a concussion. The doctor told me, “You don’t have to get\n",
      "up. Tell the nurse.” So like gentleman I tell her. And she tells me, “Get up you dirty\n",
      "dago.” Now my buddy told me that I shouldn’t take that. I pretended that I didn’t hear it.\n",
      "But the second time she said, “Get up you dirty dago wop.” I had one of those cups and I\n",
      "threw it and she ducked and it went out the window. It was put on my record. I was\n",
      "supposed to come to Philadelphia Hospital to recuperate. Father Black, he was a Lutheran\n",
      "preacher that helped me out a lot. They had to punish me. Instead of sending me to the\n",
      "Philadelphia hospital they sent me to Paris. So I was in France for a second time.\n",
      "JZ: So you were in England at this time?\n",
      "FG: Yeah I was in England. And they sent me to Paris. I couldn’t stand doing nothing. I\n",
      "needed to do something. So they put me in MP duty.\n",
      "7\n",
      "JZ: After you got your Italian degree, like you really needed it, they trained you to be a\n",
      "machine gunner?\n",
      "FG: I went to infantry camp.\n",
      "JZ: Where was this camp?\n",
      "FG: South Carolina. I liked the camp. We used to go to one town by it.\n",
      "JZ: I’m just going to backtrack here. When you got drafted, you questioned it because you\n",
      "didn’t know you were an American citizen. You went to the draft office.\n",
      "FG: No, when we went to camp. I got drafted here in Pittsburgh. They sent you camp at Fort\n",
      "Meade. From Fort Meade they separate you to whatever they need. That’s when they sent\n",
      "me to outside of Harrisburg to learn Italian. The war was over in Italy at this point. They\n",
      "didn’t need any more interpreters. So they sent me to the infantry. I was an interpreter for\n",
      "French as well when we were in France.\n",
      "JZ: You found out in the Army that you were an American citizen. The officer called you\n",
      "liar. He apologized. So in South Carolina, what division were you in?\n",
      "FG: It wasn’t a division, it was a training camp. Then once you trained there for seventeen\n",
      "weeks they sent me to the Fourth Infantry Division. The Fourth Infantry Division was\n",
      "destroyed completely.\n",
      "JZ: You weren’t a replacement were you?\n",
      "FG: No.\n",
      "JZ: What kind of gun were you training on in South Carolina?\n",
      "FG: Whatever kind you want. Machine gun, mortar, .30 caliber and .50 caliber. Then we had\n",
      "the tripod rifle with the three bullets at the same time. It was a good training camp. Head-\n",
      "to-head combat. For the little man that I was, I was tough.\n",
      "8\n",
      "JZ: On your first day of this training camp, what were your emotions?\n",
      "FG: I knew some people from the Old Country. The only thing was that they speak different\n",
      "down south and I couldn’t understand them. You would focus day to day. I wasn’t scared.\n",
      "As a matter of fact, I was never scared. The only time I got scared was when General\n",
      "McNair and General Roosevelt and the Eighth Air Force came from England.\n",
      "JZ: After your training for seventeen weeks in South Carolina you were shipped to England?\n",
      "FG: We went to Boston. We spent three weeks there. I was training to be an MP there. From\n",

      "three more days abroad a train and went to Scotland. Then from Scotland we went to\n",
      "South Hampton and stayed there for a little while. Across the Channel we were told they\n",
      "could kill us so we practiced. We lost one boat with forty soldiers on it because a\n",

      "FG: Yeah.\n",
      "JZ: What other weapons did you carry on you?\n",
      "FG: I had a pistol.\n",
      "JZ: When did you landed in Liverpool? What month?\n",
      "FG: It early, it was before Easter. We took another train to Scotland. I loved Scotland.\n",
      "Beautiful.\n",
      "9\n",
      "JZ: You were trained and as soon as you landed you went?\n",
      "FG: Yeah. They would give you the little guns and shots.\n",
      "JZ: For what?\n",
      "FG: I don’t know. Shots.\n",
      "[End Tape 1, Side A]\n",
      "[Begin Tape 1, Side B]\n",
      "FG: When we were in England, me and my buddy went to eat at a little restaurant. They\n",
      "spoke two languages there. So the waiter asked me what I wanted to eat. I didn’t know\n",
      "what to say. I said, “Make me something to eat, it doesn’t matter what.” Take a guess of\n",
      "what he brought me? A big bowl of escargot with the hot peppers and the French bread\n",
      "and a glass wine. Oh, boy I loved it. It was three o’clock in the morning and I ate the\n",
      "whole damn thing by myself. The guy told me, “I knew you were probably Italian and I\n",
      "knew you would like a big meal.” He spoke Italian better than me, he wasn’t Italian. He\n",
      "just studied two or three languages.\n",
      "JZ: That was in Paris? Getting back to England when you were in South Hampton. Were you\n",
      "in South Hampton when D-Day happened?\n",
      "FG: I was in England abroad a ship on the Channel but the storm held us back.\n",
      "JZ: Did you want to go to England? Would you have preferred to go to Italy?\n",
      "FG: Well I was going to but then it was changed. But it the beginning I was going. When I\n",
      "was sick in the hospital I would have liked to go. The first time we were supposed to go\n",
      "to Italy we were going to leave on Sunday night and on Friday morning it was changed.\n",
      "That was canceled. The second time I was supposed to go through the north but that was\n",
      "changed. So then they asked us to go see Holland, and Norway. They gave me a fifteen\n",
      "10\n",
      "days pass. With the money I had and my clothes I went. It was cold but it was beautiful.\n",
      "It was the best vacation I have ever had.\n",
      "JZ: Getting back, you landed on June 10th or June 6th? Or was D-Day the 16th? When you\n",
      "landed on the beach what did it look like?\n",
      "FG: The beaches had bodies all over the place. I remember when we landed, they were still\n",
      "fighting. They had a machine gun and a long distance cannon they would shoot from the\n",
      "wall. When we landed a lieutenant lost his leg and went back to the boat. They would tell\n",
      "us, “Whenever you get there, do like what Napoleon would do. Bend down and grab a\n",
      "handful of sand and squeeze it in your hand until it would come out all over. That would\n",
      "mean that God would help you.\n",
      "JZ: How did you get onto the beach?\n",
      "FG: In a barge. You would get close to the land and walk a little through the water. The water\n",
      "would be up to here on me. Brave or not you had to walk through it, 6’1”, 6’2”. Here I\n",
      "am 5’5”. I think I was 5’6” and 137 pounds. Now I’m 5’3”. I shrunk three inches. I was\n",
      "fit as a ram.\n",
      "JZ: How did you go inland? Were you in a jeep?\n",
      "FG: Oh, yeah. In the tanks, even. See we were spearhead division. Do you know what that is?\n",
      "JZ: No.\n",
      "FG: You’re supposed to pick up and we rode the tanks until we got there. When we got there\n",
      "we would wait until the units would come out. You would hold the place. In other words,\n",
      "you would have to help them before they could help you. That’s why it was called the\n",
      "spearhead division. When we got there, there was danger. And that’s what I told you\n",
      "about the night patrol. We had a Mexican man, he was good at night. God damned\n",
      "German dogs were barking like Hell. That’s no good because the enemy would know you\n",
      "were. If they knew you were here they would bombard you with the cannon. We killed\n",
      "the dogs at night with a knife. That’s mean.\n",
      "11\n",
      "JZ: When you went to Saint Lo right?\n",
      "FG: The Battle of Saint Lo? Yeah.\n",
      "JZ: Tell me about that.\n",
      "FG: OK. Five o’clock in the morning we got to Saint Lo. Six o’clock in the evening we had to\n",
      "come back. So finally one morning at like three o’clock, the 8th and the 9th Air Force\n",
      "from England came in and surrounded it in two. That’s when we lost a lot of people from\n",
      "our own fire. General Roosevelt and General McNair got hit that day.\n",
      "JZ: Oh, that’s how they got killed.\n",
      "FG: Yeah, that’s how they got killed. They say no but I know they got killed. You’re\n",
      "supposed to shut up too. But what I saw there, young man, was incredible. You saw men\n",
      "split in two. You lose your cool. They would give us a shot to help us. Sometimes it\n",
      "wouldn’t help. A lot of people went nuts.\n",
      "JZ: They would give you a shot?\n",
      "FG: They would give us shots all over the place.\n",
      "JZ: When you were in combat? To calm you down?\n",
      "FG: Oh yeah. Sometimes they would give us drinks, lemonade or coffee with something in it.\n",
      "JZ: You know what it was called?\n",
      "FG: I don’t know what it was called. You finish the cup and you wouldn’t give a damn about\n",
      "the war.\n",
      "JZ: When you first experienced combat what did you think?\n",
      "12\n",
      "FG: At first I thought it was joke. I didn’t see anyone. When people would start to fall in front\n",
      "of you then you would think about it. When you’re young, they would tell you “Be alert,\n",
      "take cover.” That’s what we did. But then what got me shook up was that I killed a\n",
      "German. I know I did. It was him and I. I was a little bit faster than him and I shot him.\n",
      "Oh, I went to a priest. You kill a man for Christ’s sake. How much can you take?\n",
      "JZ: So during the Battle of Saint Lo you were with the machine gun?\n",
      "FG: Oh yeah, definitely. Big deal after the catastrophe you would get three days off to\n",
      "recuperate. You needed those three days off. The last combat was the Battle of the\n",
      "Bulge. When we got done we would come home and rest. It was a small European\n",
      "village. The Germans were a little fanatic because they knew they lost. When we cross\n",
      "from Belgium to Germany there was a quick divider. The first thing they did was try to\n",
      "take our bags. I wouldn’t give it to them. I didn’t. I had a lot of stuff in there. I had\n",
      "Chanel Number Five in there that I stole. Oh we stole a lot of stuff. And when we come\n",
      "back before going home I would take more. It was a beautiful town that you could see on\n",
      "a Christmas card. Now, if you put the white flag up, it would mean that you surrendered.\n",
      "The Germans were inside the church. The major was a smart man, he was from the south.\n",
      "The three groups divided into three groups. The men in the middle got a little hurt, seven\n",
      "soldiers were killed. What the major did was call back the units. He used white fosters\n",
      "and burned the town. When you put a white flag you would surrender and live but they\n",
      "didn’t.\n",
      "JZ: Tell me about the German soldiers, you said they were fanatics.\n",
      "FG: The Germans soldiers didn’t care. The special troops were fanatics and would walk\n",
      "alone. The little soldiers, the G.I. soldier, didn’t give a damn. I liked one. I even worked\n",
      "in a gas station in Antwerp, Belgium. He came up and said to me something and I paid no\n",
      "attention. I guess he was telling me there was danger in the station but I couldn’t\n",
      "understand. Up came smoke. We took care of him good. This you’re going to like. There\n",
      "was man, a captain, from the Canadian troops who would send food to the troops. He\n",
      "came off the highway for gas. He looked at me and said, “You’re Italian?” “Yes.” He\n",
      "said, “Do you speak Italian?” “Yeah I come from there, sure.” He tells me, “I need fifty\n",

      "13\n",
      "go to jail. I will sign for it properly but I have no reparation.” I said to myself that if I\n",
      "don’t give it to him, but I gave it to him. He told me you would be back next week. And\n",
      "next week he came back. You got to believe me, a station wagon full of food. He told me,\n",
      "“It’s yours.” I said, “Captain, I helped you, you help me.” The house that we rented was\n",
      "an old man and an old woman. And this old man spoke pretty good English. He said,\n",
      "“We don’t have a place to keep it all.”\n",
      "JZ: You were in Antwerp for a while?\n",
      "FG: Oh yeah. Antwerp was a nice town. I liked it.\n",
      "JZ: Tell me about the march. You had to march all across France didn’t you?\n",
      "FG: Yeah. We marched until we got to Paris. We took Paris at about four o’clock in the\n",
      "morning and we camped there. Two God damned German soldiers were shooting like\n",
      "Hell. What can you do? We had an Army and they had two soldiers. Fanatics. On the\n",
      "fourth day the 28th Division from Pennsylvania marched in the parade in Paris. The 4th\n",
      "Division had to stand guard on the other side. How do you like that? We were taken care\n",
      "of too. General Patton was there. He made a speech. The point was seventeen. He said\n",
      "“What will be the best to pick up seventeen in twenty-four hours or to spend four days\n",
      "and lose the same about of men?” Initially the sooner the better. If you die you die. And\n",
      "that’s what he did, he gave the order. Oh hey, they took seventeen in less than twenty-\n",
      "four hours.\n",
      "JZ: What’s seventeen?\n",
      "FG: The number. They used numbers. You would report by numbers.\n",
      "JZ: Did you see General Patton?\n",
      "FG: Oh yeah I saw Patton, maybe he was twenty-five feet ahead of me. I saw Eisenhower. All\n",
      "of the Generals. One British guy, I hate him. He was a fanatic.\n",
      "JZ: What did you think of Patton?\n",
      "14\n",
      "FG: Yeah I liked General Patton. You know he was a little bit of a fanatic but he studied\n",
      "history and that’s how he became a great general. He studied Alexander the Great and\n",
      "that’s how he became a good general. I know. He studied at West Point. You know who\n",
      "was Alexander the Great? He was twenty-five years old when he died. He was the most\n",
      "power, more powerful than Napoleon. He was a powerful man. His father was a king. I\n",
      "had good teachers. I know these things.\n",
      "JZ: After Paris where did you go?\n",
      "FG: Close to Belgium. From Antwerp we came back. We went to New York. That’s when we\n",
      "came home.\n",
      "JZ: You were wounded?\n",
      "FG: Oh, yeah. I spent three months in England. Two and a half months in the hospital.\n",
      "JZ: How were you wounded?\n",
      "FG: I got a spinal concussion. It was railroad cannon that those German used to use. We were\n",
      "in a fox hole. Seven of us were in there, machine gunners. Three of us survived, the rest\n",
      "died. From there they put us on the airplane to England to the hospital.\n",
      "JZ: So you were in a fox hole in Belgium? Was this during the Bulge? They had a huge a\n",
      "railroad gun?\n",
      "FG: Yeah. Yeah.\n",
      "JZ: Were you unconscious?\n",
      "FG: No, I think my brains were good. I was almost paralyzed. They put me in the stretcher.\n",
      "The one think I don’t like was the Red Cross. I hate them. They would see a soldier on\n",
      "the ground almost dying. They save an officer? Yes. A soldier? No. What’s the matter\n",
      "with them? Why? I was told when we got discharged in Fort Dix, they asked, “You want\n",
      "15\n",
      "the Red Cross?” I said, “No, the last thing I want is the Red Cross. No offense against\n",
      "you.” I like the Salvation Army but not the Red Cross. The Salvation Army helped me\n",
      "but the Red Cross didn’t.\n",
      "JZ: After they took England, you were in the hospital for how long?\n",
      "FG: For almost three months. That’s when I hit the nurse.\n",
      "JZ: Explain that again. You were in the hospital?\n",
      "FG: They would put you in the whirlpool for over an hour to relax your muscles. In the\n",
      "morning you were supposed to get up and fix your bed and call in. The captain told me to\n",
      "fix my bed and call him again. I wanted to tell him to go to hell but as a gentleman I\n",
      "didn’t.\n",
      "JZ: Then the nurse came over.\n",
      "FG: She came over and called me a dirty dago and I pretended I didn’t hear it. But the second\n",
      "time she called me a dirty dago wop and that’s when I couldn’t take it. And I didn’t.\n",
      "JZ: What did you do?\n",
      "FG: I threw the cup and hit the window. If I would have hit her, I would have killed her.\n",
      "JZ: Was she Army nurse?\n",
      "FG: She was an American nurse of the 1st and ten. The English would treat you good.\n",
      "JZ: Afterwards, what immediately happened?\n",
      "FG: The MP put me in a cold shower. They thought I was nuts. To cool me off. I was Section\n",
      "Eight for five days. They thought I was crazy. When my captain came up I told him what\n",
      "happened and why I hit her. I never saw that woman again.\n",
      "16\n",
      "JZ: They never reprimanded her?\n",
      "FG: No. Instead of sending me to Philadelphia they sent me to Paris.\n",
      "JZ: This is the spring of 1945?\n",
      "FG: Yeah. I liked Paris people.\n",

      "statue of Lord Nelson, the guy with one arm, one leg and one eye. Trafalgar\n",
      "Square. Well this is where he was from, and they had this statue of this man, half-\n",
      "man.\n",
      "10\n",
      "JZ: It took you three weeks to cross the Atlantic, did you ever come under attack by\n",
      "U-boats or put on warning or did you have to put on any life vests?\n",
      "LL: Can’t remember of any.\n",
      "JZ: What was the typical equipment did you have besides the .45 or the tripod, what\n",
      "were the other items?\n",
      "LL: In my packet I had my blanket, my raincoat, a knife, a bayonet and of course half\n",
      "a dozen hand grenades. Oh, and half of a tent.\n",
      "JZ: Real little?\n",
      "LL: Well, no two of them together two guys could sleep in them. You always had to\n",
      "find another guy to put the two of them together but most of the time all we did\n",
      "was wrap up in them. More or less, lay it on the ground and get in it with a\n",
      "blanket and wrap everything up like a cocoon. It was too much bother to be\n",
      "putting up a tent every night.\n",
      "JZ: I imagine all you guys once you got into combat in Europe ditched all that stuff.\n",
      "LL: No, well you had to sleep. You had to have it.\n",
      "JZ: What did you do in Oklahoma for fun?\n",
      "LL: We had the U.S.O. Shows there, and we had the social service clubs with pool\n",
      "tables and ping-pong table. But half the time you were too tired to go to those\n",
      "places, you come back from a 25 mile hike you wouldn’t even feel like playing\n",
      "pool. All you wanted to do was take a shower and get some sleep. They would\n",
      "wake you up at four in the morning.\n",
      "11\n",
      "JZ: Going back to England, how long were you in Bath?\n",
      "LL: I was only there couple weeks and we headed over to the coast of France.\n",
      "JZ: When did you hear about D-Day? Were you still on the ship, did the military\n",
      "inform you guys? How did you first find out about it?\n",
      "LL: I guess I was in Bath when I heard about it. Of course we were all cheering, but\n",
      "we did not realize how much causalities were involved. You don’t think about\n",
      "that because nothing is going to happen to you, it’s going to happen to the other\n",
      "guy.\n",
      "JZ: I guess you had to think like that.\n",
      "LL: That’s the way they teach you to think. See that’s the difference between the\n",
      "American Army and the German Army. Every guy in the American Army\n",
      "figured nothing was going to happen to him, it’s going to happen to the other guy.\n",
      "If the sergeant got killed it didn’t matter someone else would take over. But the\n",
      "Germans weren’t taught that, when the sergeant got killed they were lost, they\n",
      "didn’t know what to do any more. They would throw up their hands. That was\n",
      "they thing we always tried to do was the guy that had the stripes, knock him off\n",
      "and the other guys would be lost. They couldn’t think for themselves. They were\n",
      "machines. Every man in my squad could do my job, and I could do their job. It\n",
      "was the same way with the sergeant that ran our squad. Half the time we told him\n",
      "to go to Hell and that I was the boss, I was the gunner.\n",
      "JZ: Who was your rank, PFC?\n",
      "LL: Yeah.\n",
      "JZ: Did you have any interaction with the British when you were in Bath?\n",
      "12\n",
      "LL: No.\n",
      "JZ: So after Bath, you got onto another ship?\n",
      "LL: Yeah we got on one of those things to cross the English Channel and I joined my\n",
      "division at Saint Lou. That was the day we were bombed by 4,000 of our own\n",
      "planes. The sky was black with planes.\n",
      "JZ: How were you accidentally bombed by America’s own planes?\n",
      "LL: The way I understand it that there were some kind of banners or flags or some\n",
      "kind of markers that they supposed to bomb south of these markers but we\n",
      "advanced past the markers, we were in the area that was supposed to get bombed.\n",
      "We went too fast.\n",
      "JZ: So this was at Saint Lou?\n",
      "LL: That was the day I told those guys that if I survive this and I have to come back\n",
      "into the service I’m going to come back to join you. Yeah there were a lot of\n",
      "planes. It looked like a black cloud, they were all planes.\n",
      "JZ: So you must have had explosions all around you?\n",
      "LL: It was the worst thing I ever lived through.\n",
      "JZ: Were there Germans shooting at you?\n",
      "LL: That was the only thing that was bothering us, hadn’t seen a German yet.\n",
      "JZ: So this was the day you landed?\n",
      "13\n",
      "LL: The first day of combat, that was my baptism.\n",
      "JZ: Did you land on one of the D-Day beaches?\n",
      "LL: See, all the fighting was over on the beaches. If I remember right, it was Omaha\n",
      "beach but don’t hold me to that.\n",
      "JZ: When you got off shore, you started going inland?\n",
      "LL: Yeah, we went by jeep to where the 9th was in Saint Lou.\n",
      "JZ: So how long did that take you?\n",
      "LL: Not long, it was only a matter of twenty miles or so.\n",
      "JZ: So you were in your jeep when the planes came?\n",
      "LL: No, I already was already up there. I already had my hole dug. I never came out\n",
      "of that hole.\n",
      "JZ: You were in a fox hole the whole time they were bombing?\n",
      "LL: Yeah.\n",
      "JZ: How close would you think the bombs were to you?\n",
      "LL: I saw all these people get killed. I saw guys get blown out of the holes. A bomb\n",
      "would hit and you would see a body fly in the air. That’s enough to scare the hell\n",
      "out of you. You know that guy that is trying to get rid of the “Under God” in our\n",
      "Pledge of Allegiance? He wasn’t there. There were no atheists in the fox holes\n",
      "14\n",
      "that day. Everybody was praying to God. If you weren’t one before that, you\n",
      "became one there. We always said there were no atheists in the fox holes.\n",
      "JZ: How long did that last, a couple of hours just because you advanced past a certain\n",
      "mark?\n",
      "LL: Yeah they had these things, like banners they would lay down. That’s where we\n",
      "were supposed to be on each side of the banners. But we had overrun them.\n",
      "JZ: Were you able to call in?\n",
      "LL: They didn’t have the sophisticated communications that they have these days.\n",
      "They had a radio that weighed about a hundred pounds that the guy had to carry\n",
      "around. Today they have them in their back pockets.\n",
      "[End Tape 1, Side A]\n",
      "[Begin Tape 1, Side B]\n",
      "JZ: So after your day of baptism of fire, what did you do after that?\n",
      "LL: Well we fought through Normandy. We went into Belgium and into Germany.\n",
      "One night I heard some activity in front of me. I called into headquarters to find\n",
      "out if we had anything going on out there, any patrols out there and he said, “No.”\n",
      "So I picked up my rifle. I didn’t want to fire my machine gun at night because it’s\n",
      "like daylight when you shot 250 rounds it’s like daylight around you.\n",
      "JZ: Oh, so they could have seen your position.\n",
      "LL: Yeah, so I picked up a rifle and I shot at where the noise was coming from. I got\n",
      "out of the hole to see what I hit, and someone shot it. I got hit. I was lucky. That’s\n",
      "when it got daylight around me because after he shot me I turned my machine gun\n",
      "15\n",
      "on him. I got shot under my left knee. I spent six months in a cast from my toe all\n",
      "the way up to here. I got hit November the fifteenth.\n",
      "JZ: This was November of 1944? So you were in Germany by this time?\n",
      "LL: Yeah I was way in Germany. I was in the hospital until I was discharged and sent\n",
      "home in the last part of September of 1945. I was in the hospital all that time.\n",
      "JZ: Were you involved in the Battle of Saint Lou?\n",
      "LL: Yeah.\n",
      "JZ: I’ve heard of that, Saint Lou was a city and you had to get the Germans out of that\n",
      "city.\n",
      "LL: Yeah that’s why they were bombing us over there, they were bombing that. The\n",
      "hedge rows were a rough place. We had to fight one hedge row to the next.\n",
      "JZ: So it was countryside with hedges?\n",
      "LL: Yeah, like I have hedges all around my house. Well that’s what they had all\n",
      "around there. Acres. I guess to keep the cows in. They didn’t have fences. They\n",
      "had these hedges all over the place. We had to go from one to the other. Each\n",
      "one might be a hundred feet from mine and the next guy and we had to clear it all\n",
      "out. The Germans were on one side, we were on the other. And like idiots we\n",
      "were shooting at each other. Now we’re buddies, now we’re friends.\n",
      "JZ: After that you went into Saint Lou?\n",
      "LL: Yeah we went straight through it.\n",
      "16\n",
      "JZ: How long were you engaged with the Germans? What would you do, set up the\n",
      "tripod and help fire the machine gun.\n",
      "LL: I would throw my tripod down and Julie would come down and stick the gun in\n",
      "it. Another guy would hand me a box of ammunition and I would load it. We\n",
      "would fire it in the general direction of where the Germans were. One time I was\n",
      "firing at a target that was five miles from where I was at, I didn’t even see what I\n",
      "was firing at.\n",
      "JZ: They would travel that far?\n",
      "LL: Yeah, over and down. I still have my World War II notebook with the targets of\n",
      "what I was firing at. Here, I’ll show you.\n",
      "JZ: It says 600 rounds a minute. It was a .30 caliber Browning machine gun. And in\n",
      "that too was water, and you had to put water in there too?\n",
      "LL: Oh yeah all the time you had to put water in there. Otherwise, you run 600 bullets\n",
      "through there in a minute and that thing would be red hot. The water would be\n",
      "boiling; you could make coffee with it. It held about two gallons of water.\n",
      "JZ: So there would be some guy that would pour water and that would be his job?\n",
      "LL: Yeah, he kept a can full of water.\n",
      "JZ: And he would have to carry it?\n",
      "LL: He carried it.\n",
      "JZ: Where would you guys find water? I guess it would be tough, sometimes you\n",
      "couldn’t find water.\n",
      "17\n",
      "LL: Well, there would always be water behind us in the kitchens. The kitchens came\n",
      "behind us. They weren’t too far from us.\n",
      "JZ: You guys eat K-rations or C-rations?\n",
      "LL: C-rations or K-rations. Still to this day I can’t eat baked beans unless they are\n",
      "cold. I don’t like them hot, I like them cold. I got used to them that way.\n",
      "JZ: How would you say in combat, you didn’t have time to think, you reacted?\n",
      "LL: That’s right, you did it instinctively.\n",
      "JZ: I guess the first time you were nervous.\n",
      "LL: Yeah, I guess.\n",
      "JZ: How would you say the Germans, were they tough?\n",
      "LL: Sure they were tough but they were robots. They were not taught to think for\n",
      "themselves. They were taught to carry out orders. If the sergeant told them to\n",
      "shoot ten times, that’s what he would shoot. If there were fifty guys coming\n",
      "towards them, they would shoot only ten times because that’s what they were\n",
      "told.\n",
      "JZ: When you were in Saint Lou, were they dug in?\n",
      "LL: Yeah, everyone was dug in. Sometimes we would use each other’s holes.\n",
      "JZ: How would you say when you were in Saint Lou, constant fighting, firing your\n",
      "machine gun all the time?\n",
      "18\n",
      "LL: No, not really.\n",
      "JZ: How long was Saint Lou?\n",
      "LL: A couple days. It wasn’t bad. There were worse fights than Saint Lou that I was\n",
      "in.\n",
      "JZ: Did you catch any German prisoners?\n",
      "LL: Me, no. I never captured any. We didn’t take prisoners. What was I going to do\n",
      "with the machine guns?\n",
      "JZ: So you were still part of the 9th Infantry Division?\n",
      "LL: Yeah, up until the day I got shot.\n",
      "JZ: So after Saint Lou, you went to Paris and up in that way. Was Patton in charge of\n",
      "the 9th?\n",
      "LL: No, Omar Bradley. Best General they had in the United States Army.\n",
      "JZ: Better than Patton?\n",
      "LL: Better than any of them.\n",
      "JZ: Better than Eisenhower?\n",
      "LL: Better than Eisenhower. Eisenhower compared to Omar? No.\n",
      "JZ: What made Bradley better in your opinion?\n",
      "19\n",
      "LL: He was a human. We had to take a hill for instance. He figured it how we could\n",
      "take that hill without anyone getting hurt. He worked his way around it to get to\n",
      "it. Whereas, guys like Patton it was your blood and his guts. They didn’t care\n",
      "about you.\n",
      "JZ: What about Eisenhower?\n",
      "LL: Eisenhower. He was a phony as a general and he was a phony as a president.\n",
      "JZ: So I guess fighting the Germans got a little easier after D-Day and the liberation\n",
      "of Paris, did it go a little faster?\n",
      "LL: They saw that the end was coming. Their last hurrah was the Battle of the Bulge.\n",
      "JZ: Were you every bombed by the Germans?\n",
      "LL: Yeah all the time. You’re in a fox hole, no one would bother you. I think while I\n",
      "was in Germany, a funny story in a way, I dug a hole for my machine gun\n",
      "placement, of course I slept in there. So we were outside of this town, it had one\n",
      "of those baby farms that the Germans had all over Germany. They had these\n",
      "young girls and they would bring in their heroes in. The girls would service them;\n",
      "they would have babies for Hitler’s youth. So this was one of those towns. I\n",
      "went into the house and took the mattress out of the bedroom and brought it down\n",
      "to my hole so I could sleep on the mattress instead of the ground. Now the next\n",
      "day, I don’t know what made me do it, I rolled the mattress up and tied it with a\n",
      "rope. I was bringing it back into the house again. I came out of the hole with this\n",
      "thing in front of me; a bomb went off and blew me back into the hole again. Not\n",
      "a scratch on me but that mattress was all torn to shreds. If I haven’t had that\n",
      "mattress in front of me I would have blown to Hell. I would have been gone. But\n",
      "that mattress saved my life. I always said God takes care of drunks and fools and\n",
      "20\n",
      "told me to bring the mattress back and that’s what I was doing. I don’t know\n",
      "whether it’s tragic or funny or what it is, but that’s one thing I will never forget. I\n",
      "can still see that mattress all shredded up with stuff all over it.\n",
      "JZ: How far did it blow you back?\n",
      "LL: It blew me right back into the hole again; I was just getting out of the hole. I got\n",
      "religion that day. Believe me. Even my Jew friend got religion that day when he\n",
      "saw me blown into that hole.\n",
      "JZ: Were a lot of guys near you? Were you in the front line?\n",
      "LL: Yeah this was the point.\n",
      "JZ: Where this building was?\n",
      "LL: It was behind me.\n",
      "JZ: Speaking of religion, was there a Chaplin that would come by?\n",
      "LL: Yeah the priest that was with us would have Mass out in the field. He would set\n",
      "his crucifix on the hood of the jeep; that was the altar that we would be standing\n",
      "around watching him. I went to Mass in German churches. I went to Mass in\n",
      "French churches.\n",
      "JZ: You didn’t fight in the Bulge?\n",
      "LL: No, I was already shot. I was already in the hospital.\n",
      "JZ: Where you in Germany at this time?\n",
      "21\n",
      "LL: Yeah, I was in that baby factory.\n",
      "JZ: And what was the name of this place?\n",
      "LL: Schevenhutte.\n",
      "JZ: So this is right before the Bulge? Before you got shot?\n",
      "LL: Well the Bulge was after I got shot. If I remember right, I was in the hospital in a\n",
      "cave were they had brought me. When the Bulge started, they brought me from\n",
      "there to a hospital in Paris. I saw Paris through a back window of an ambulance.\n",
      "And from Paris, I went to England. They operated on me in Paris.\n",
      "JZ: Got the bullet out?\n",
      "LL: No, they didn’t have to get the bullet out. It was gone, it didn’t slow down. Felt\n",
      "like someone hit me with a baseball bat knocking me flat on my face because I\n",
      "was standing when someone hit it.\n",
      "JZ: So was there a medic that treated you there?\n",
      "LL: The medic, I’ll tell you about this guy. He lives in Masontown, PA, his name was\n",
      "Walter Vicinelly. Walter was a medic, he came over and picked me up and threw\n",
      "me over his shoulders and he ran about three miles with me hanging up there to\n",
      "get me to battalion aid station were they could work on my leg. That was 1944,\n",
      "this is sixty years later, and he and I are still the best of friends.\n",
      "JZ: He ran three miles with you on his back?\n",
      "LL: Yeah and I weighed 200 pounds.\n",
      "22\n",
      "JZ: He got you back, and then you went to Paris? Did they operate on you there?\n",
      "LL: No, they just wrapped me up and get me to stop bleeding. They didn’t have the\n",
      "facilities to operate so they shipped me back to Paris.\n",
      "JZ: It shattered your leg?\n",
      "LL: My whole leg was shattered. The tibia was all shattered and above the knee\n",
      "where it was hit. I was cast from here all the way down to my toes. It took me a\n",
      "year to heal, so they did a hell of a job on me.\n",
      "JZ: I can see the indent but it’s hard to even notice that anything happened.\n",
      "LL: You could tell. I have an artificial valve in my heart, a steel valve in my heart.\n",
      "You can’t tell. I got a foot and a half of my colon missing, can’t tell. God takes\n",
      "care of me.\n",
      "JZ: Where did you recover in England for a year?\n",
      "LL: I was in England in a place called Leeds. I was in the hospital there for,\n",
      "November to April, for six months. Then they shipped to the States and I went to\n",
      "Stanton, VA for about two months. Then I went up to Long Island until I got\n",
      "discharged in the last part of September 1945.\n",
      "JZ: The whole time you were being rehabilitated too? So they took the cast off?\n",
      "LL: Yeah, they put me to work driving an ambulance in Long Island after they took\n",
      "the cast off. I had to have something to do, I couldn’t just play around.\n",
      "JZ: Did they ever talk about sending you back to Europe?\n",
      "23\n",
      "LL: No, by the time they took that cast off and threw away crutches the war was over\n",
      "in Europe.\n",
      "JZ: So I guess you were relieved?\n",
      "LL: No, I was sweating out going to Japan. Luckily the war ended over there and they\n",
      "sent me home.\n",
      "JZ: Did you hear that they dropped the atomic bomb, what did you think of it, the\n",
      "power of this new weapon?\n",
      "LL: I said, “Great. They should have done it before.”\n",
      "JZ: On the Japanese?\n",
      "LL: I don’t want to use the word brainwashed, but you’re psyched-out against the\n",
      "enemy. They’re the enemy. Pretty hard to sympathize when they throw an A-\n",
      "Bomb and kill a half of million. Thank God they didn’t bring it over here. In\n",
      "doing that, how many American lives did they save? To invade Japan and hit\n",
      "those shores, there would have been a lot of causalities. And probably a lot more\n",
      "Japanese than did die, a lot would have been dying.\n",
      "JZ: Describe coming home? You were in Long Island and took the train to\n",
      "Pittsburgh? No parade?\n",
      "LL: Parade? No. We didn’t have anything. There was no welcoming party, you just\n",
      "went home. I got home on a Friday and Monday I went to work at Westinghouse.\n",
      "JZ: When you were wounded, were you in contact with dad and your family?\n",
      "24\n",
      "LL: Oh yeah, I wrote them before the army. I wrote home and told them they would\n",
      "be getting a telegram from the army telling you I was wounded but don’t worry\n",
      "about it, I’m okay, don’t get excited.\n",
      "JZ: Isn’t the army supposed to be the first one? They’re always going to the door.\n",
      "LL: Yeah well when there’s ten thousand other people it takes awhile to get to\n",
      "everybody.\n",
      "JZ: So you received the Purple Heart. Did you get the Purple Heart when you were in\n",
      "the hospital? Tell me about that.\n",
      "LL: Yeah I got the Purple Heart when I was in the hospital. The colonel came around\n",
      "and pinned it on me and gave me a kiss. As far as I was concerned, the Purple\n",
      "Heart was worth five points towards getting a discharge. You had to get so many\n",
      "points to be getting out of service.\n",
      "JZ: Explain that point system to me. The more points you had the faster you got of\n",
      "the military?\n",
      "LL: Yeah. You got one point for every month you were in the service. And for every\n",
      "month you were overseas you got extra points. And for every citation or Medal\n",
      "you got there was extra point. Now the Purple Heart was worth five points, some\n",
      "were worth two, some were worth ten. But the Purple Heart was worth five\n",
      "points. Now I had another one, Combat Infantry badge, it was worth five points.\n",
      "And I got ten dollars a month for my pay. The Combat Infantry Badge, I got that\n",
      "while fighting over there.\n",

      "We go away once a year for two week’s vacation, so I went with them. It was\n",

      "JZ: How big was the coal mine he had?\n",
      "WV: It was his coal mine, it wasn’t that large compared to the larger mines. It probably\n",

      "He had two coal mines. One was what we called the Pittsburgh Steam Coal which\n",

      "JZ: Now where was Shadygrove again?\n",
      "WV: Shadygrove was on the hill side of Uniontown. We used to go on the street car\n",
      "that went through here. They used to have on Sunday, a dollar pass, the whole\n",

      "remember there were no lights in here, the only lights we got was from the coal\n",
      "companies. They had drills, we would be uptown and a fire whistle would blow,\n",
      "a certain signal and you would know it was an air raid. We would come down\n",
      "and I would have to patrol the street below, Cedar Avenue. You had to check\n",
      "every house to make sure no lights were on. In Masontown, there used to be a\n",
      "bank building but it burned down now, but on top of it was a little building that\n",
      "they built and it was a look out, people used to man that. They would have a\n",
      "bucket of sand up there and fire extinguishers and it was manned twenty-four\n",
      "hours a day, a scheduled setup and people used to be up there with binoculars.\n",
      "Then the bridge you crossed over the Monongahela River, they even had soldiers\n",

      "7\n",
      "WV: Yeah, a junior air warden. Did I tell the story that you weren’t allowed to smoke,\n",
      "light up a cigarette, no light at all. After I got into the war, planes would be flying\n",
      "over us. I would think how strict we were and how stupid we were. Down in the\n",
      "service, we would smoke cigarettes, try to hide it a little bit maybe not light it but\n",
      "smoke it. I’m talking about when you’re on the front line you wouldn’t do at\n",
      "night.\n",
      "JZ: So were your drafted?\n",
      "WV: Yes I was drafted when I was eighteen years old.\n",
      "JZ: When were you drafted, in 1943 right after you got out of high school?\n",
      "WV: Yeah, 1943. I graduated in May and got drafted in August. When I was in school,\n",
      "you only had a half a day of school because it was too crowded. So if you played\n",
      "football or any other sport, you went in the morning. In the afternoon you were\n",
      "off. Well after football season I went to work in the coal mine. So I was going to\n",
      "school in the morning and working in the coal mine in the afternoon. I did that\n",
      "until June when I started getting the draft notices and getting called for physicals.\n",
      "That’s when my dad said, “time to quit, you’re needed for the service.”\n",
      "JZ: He never objected. He was fine with you going into the service?\n",
      "WV: Well, I’m sure he was concerned and wished we didn’t have to go because I had a\n",
      "brother that got drafted at the same time. But we had no choice; we got drafted or\n",
      "go to jail. Anyway I’ll get into my service. I left here in August. I went to Camp\n",
      "Grant, Illinois which is in Rockford, Illinois. I had my basic training in there. I\n",
      "was in the Medical Corps; I don’t know how I got into it.\n",

      "were going to Camp Grant, Illinois, it was Medical Corps. You’re eighteen years\n",
      "old. The furthest I had ever been at that time was Pittsburgh to see a bunch of\n",
      "baseball games. Anyway at Camp Grant I had my basic training there and by\n",
      "December I was on my way to England.\n",
      "JZ: You were still at Camp Grant the whole time?\n",
      "WV: Yeah basic training was eight weeks. After basic training I came home on a five\n",
      "day furlough. Then I went to Camp Reynolds in Youngstown, and from Camp\n",
      "Reynolds they sent me to Camp Scants in New York, which was the ports\n",
      "location. I got on to the Queen Mary. It took us five days and we landed in\n",
      "Scotland. In Scotland we got on a train went to a place south of London on the\n",
      "cost by the Channel. In England we had training, we go on maneuvers.\n",
      "JZ: I’m curious to know your medical training here in the States.\n",
      "WV: Now that I know what medical training is available, there was no training. You\n",
      "learn pressure points, you learn artificial resuscitation, and you learn how to splint\n",
      "a broken leg and arm. The training when you go on maneuvers or bulwark, you\n",
      "drove an ambulance. You would just stand around the ambulance and if anyone\n",
      "got hurt you would take them to the hospital.\n",
      "JZ: What is bulwark?\n",
      "WV: Well bulwark means maneuvers but on a smaller scale.\n",
      "JZ: Is that an acronym?\n",
      "WV: That’s the accurate name of the type of training.\n",
      "9\n",
      "JZ: You know what it stands for?\n",
      "WV: If they said bulwark, it meant a day or two. When they said maneuvers,\n",
      "maneuvers involved everything, obstacle courses, shooting over your head, crawl\n",
      "on your belly and stuff like that.\n",
      "JZ: How long was your medical training?\n",
      "WV: Well the total training was eight weeks. Then when I went to England, I worked\n",
      "two days a week in the emergency room in the hospital or I would ride an\n",
      "ambulance in the community in case someone got hurt. At that time a bomb had\n",
      "taken place up around London, and we were about thirty to forty miles south of\n",
      "that. But the real training I got was in the hospital. Two days a week I would go\n",
      "to the hospital, the other days it would be down training.\n",
      "JZ: The other training was out in the field you said.\n",
      "WV: Yeah you would go on marches, five mile marches. Small obstacle courses. We\n",
      "had and stuff like that.\n",
      "JZ: What kind of equipment did you have with you? Did you have an M1?\n",
      "WV: No as a medic you were not permitted to carry a gun. At night we had to pull\n",
      "guard duty. Some of us sometime we had to guard a water tank, when you had to\n",
      "guard the water tank they would give you a gun. As a medic, I had very little rifle\n",
      "training.\n",
      "JZ: Two days a week you would go to the hospital, what would you do there?\n",
      "10\n",
      "WV: Everything. Helping people, they would want you to help. A guy would come in\n",
      "with a broken leg. Hell, I even watched an operation.\n",
      "JZ: Of course this was American military, it wasn’t a civilian hospital?\n",
      "WV: No, this was a civilian hospital that took soldiers into it.\n",
      "JZ: What was your unit, were you attached?\n",
      "WV: I was with the Ninth Infantry Division. Now the Ninth Infantry Division is made\n",
      "up of three regiments, the sixtieth, thirty-ninth, and the forth-seventh. I was with\n",
      "the forty-seventh regiment. Let me give you some history, Ninth Division made\n",
      "the invasion of North Africa and from there they made the Invasion of Sicily, then\n",
      "they went to England. I was training for the Ninth Division but I was not attached\n",
      "to them yet. I joined on December second, when I landed on Utah Beach for\n",
      "three days I stood on the beach and either worked on wounded guys or carried\n",
      "them on stretchers to the boat or L.C.I. I joined the Ninth Division on D-5 or D-6.\n",
      "They were just getting out and were coming down into the hedge rows. I don’t\n",
      "know if you know what hedge rows are but they were hedges that some were\n",
      "eight feet high and too thick to get through. It was probably six, seven feet thick.\n",
      "To get through them we used to carry a block of TNT and put it against it and\n",
      "blow a hole through it. Then later on, they came out with the tanks and put a\n",
      "blade on it like a bulldozer has, and that would open the hole for us so we could\n",
      "go through. Now, any place that there was a hole, the Germans had either a\n",
      "machine gun or anti-tank gun to cover that hole. The hedge rows were tough. If\n",
      "you move up one hedge row, they had that zeroed in, we would take a hell of a\n",
      "beating.\n",
      "JZ: I’ve heard of it. So you’re talking about big, vast area of hedges.\n",
      "11\n",
      "WV: They were placed together, you couldn’t crawl through them. Sometime you\n",
      "would get a axe and try to put a hole in it but the easiest way to do it was to get a\n",
      "block of TNT and out it in there and shot it.\n",
      "JZ: Tell me about D-Day.\n",
      "WV: Well they put me on a boat for twenty-four hours. In fact when the planes were\n",
      "going over for the invasion, I was on the ship watching. At that time they had\n",
      "gliders going over. You sat there one day then took us off to sea. From the ship\n",
      "we got onto an L.C.I. which is landing craft for infantry. When we landed, there\n",
      "was an officer there with an arm band. He told us to start working there. Now, let\n",
      "me say this to you. Omaha Beach was the rough beach; Utah was rough but not\n",
      "like that. Utah Beach they went in right away about a half a mile with little\n",
      "problems until then but after that all hell broke loose.\n",
      "JZ: You say you landed on D-2 on Utah Beach. What were you thinking, how were\n",
      "you feeling at this time?\n",
      "WV: I was scared. If someone says there were not scared, I remember my first day of\n",
      "combat hearing rifle shots, machine gun shots, you think everybody is shooting at\n",
      "you. Then as you went on, you got the attitude that you learned some with the\n",
      "experience you had, that you could get out of this. I can get out of this; I can do\n",
      "the best I can. There were times later on in the hedge rows that I didn’t sleep for\n",
      "three days or in a fox hole until two or three o’clock in the morning and say, “Hell\n",
      "I cant live like this” Hell, I even thought about shooting myself in my hand or the\n",
      "foot but never had the guts. You would be surprised, as a medic I can tell you\n",
      "this, the number of people that shot themselves in there hand or foot just to get out\n",
      "of this.\n",
      "JZ: You had the band on, and on your helmet too? As a medic you had no gun. So\n",
      "when there was action going on, combat, were always in the rear?\n",
      "12\n",
      "WV: No, you right with the infantry. If there was rifle man going up there and a sniper\n",
      "shot at him, he’s wounded, you had to go get him. If that sniper, he could shoot at\n",
      "you. Generally what you did was get the infantry to come with you, they would\n",
      "be shooting at the direction of where that shot came from. There had been times\n",
      "when I picked a guy up and put him on my shoulder and took him out of there\n",
      "when he was bleeding because if I left him there then both of us would have been\n",
      "shot and I dragged him out of there.\n",
      "JZ: Can you tell me of some instances of how you treated wounded soldiers? Can you\n",
      "give me some stories you remember.\n",
      "WV: Well, during the time I was on the front line I handled people with any type of\n",
      "wound that there was arms blown off, legs blown off, stomach wounds. In a time\n",
      "and we’ll get into later on, there was the town Greenwich, there was a guy with a\n",
      "stomach wound. During that time I had a jeep that you put the two litters on the\n",
      "front end on the hood, and then they had a rack on it that you could put three\n",
      "litters, two across the top and one down here on the opposite of the driver’s side.\n",
      "Anyway, this guy got hit with a stomach wound, he was coming out with bomb\n",
      "craters and the holes when the artilleries shells hit and bounce. This guy with the\n",
      "stomach wounds was saying to me, “you’re killing me, you’re killing me.” I’m\n",
      "sure he was in pain and concerned but with a stomach wound the faster you can\n",
      "get them out the better chance for him to survive. I wasn’t going fast. I couldn’t.\n",
      "Every time we hit a bump he would holler. After the war was over, I went to the\n",
      "division reunion in Philadelphia and this guy came up to me and told me, “I was\n",
      "that guy on that thing hollering. I believe you were trying to do you’re best.”\n",
      "You know one night I was out on patrol with the infantry and we came back in the\n",
      "morning, like five o’clock before daylight I went to the aid station. The aid\n",
      "station was generally close to the front line, a half a mile. There were times front\n",
      "lines would be on the hill and there’s a house or town there and the aid station\n",
      "would be in the house. Anyway, I came in, the captain was there and he was from\n",
      "13\n",
      "Sharpsville. He was a doctor, an Italian surgeon, Captain Lali. I came in and was\n",
      "loading up my two first aid packets. He says to me that he doesn’t want me to go\n",
      "down to the line and get some sleep downstairs. I told him I could just sleep in the\n",
      "hole up there. He says, “No get a blanket and sleep because I’m going to need\n",
      "you tonight.” It wasn’t half hour when they came down to get me. Five more\n",
      "medics were on the jeep going up to the front line, which was a half a mile away\n",
      "and they hit a mine and all five of them were killed. I had a picture of the jeep that\n",

      "mentioned the Forty-Seventh and Thirtieth Battalion, there were 510 wounded\n",
      "and 129 killed. Two days later we got on Patton’s tanks and took off across\n",
      "France. Sometime again if we hit a pocket of Germans we would de delayed a\n",
      "day or two at the most and then move own.\n",
      "JZ: Most of the time did you have your own jeep?\n",
      "WV: Well that depends, like during the hedge rows the jeep was no good to you. After\n",
      "we got up into the towns where you could use the jeep, in the front lines you\n",
      "walked across or if you had a wounded guy you carried if back to the jeep and\n",
      "took him to the aid station. The aid station had three jeeps with brackets on it that\n",
      "you would be able to put five litters on it.\n",
      "JZ: And a litter would be?\n",
      "WV: A stretcher.\n",
      "JZ: How long were you in the hedge rows? How long were you there for in that area?\n",
      "WV: I’m trying to figure that out, well that was in July. I’m going to say a couple of\n",
      "months.\n",
      "JZ: Did you ever work on German soldiers?\n",
      "WV: Oh yeah there were times when you had a wounded German soldier you would\n",
      "work on. Even civilians. If got a small town with no doctors and you got a\n",
      "wounded person you would work on them.\n",
      "JZ: During those times you saw so much, how did you handle it emotionally?\n",
      "15\n",
      "WV: I told you, at first you said no one could live here, you got to get out of it. Then\n",
      "you could see no one could get out of it so you got the attitude you were going to\n",
      "do the best you could. You’re going to take chances, don’t get me wrong, but\n",

      "JZ: Seeing the soldiers wounded and dying?\n",
      "WV: Well, that was your job and you felt bad but you couldn’t get yourself in a\n",
      "position when it bothered you. It did bother you but not that it was going to affect\n",
      "the job you had to do.\n",
      "JZ: Tell me, what was you’re rank?\n",
      "WV: Staff Sergeant. I was offered a battlefield promotion to second lieutenant and I\n",

      "the ranks they would give you a battle field promotion. I didn’t want it.\n",
      "JZ: How did you make sergeant?\n",

      "promoted me to staff sergeant.\n",
      "JZ: What was some of the equipment you had when you were on the field as a medic?\n",
      "WV: Well you had two packs and it had all the first aid equipment you needed,\n",

      "leg. There were times, depends where you were at, if a guy had a broken leg you\n",
      "16\n",
      "would make a blanket splint. You would roll a blanket up and tie it up tights with\n",
      "both legs together and get him out of there. We carried morphine, blood plasma.\n",
      "In fact we carried blood plasma right on the jeep. That was about it, when we got\n",
      "to the aid station, there wasn’t much they could do either other than the first step\n",
      "to control bleeding. If he was in shock, treat him stat and get him an ambulance to\n",
      "get him to a field hospital as fast as you could.\n",
      "JZ: Yeah I’m curious, when you think of hospital you think of MASH and the Korean\n",
      "War. And of course during World War II they didn’t have helicopters so how\n",
      "would you evacuate them by ambulance as fast as you could?\n",
      "WV: Ambulance. We had two ambulances, put them in the ambulance and they would\n",
      "take them back even in the middle of the night. They had some rough times too\n",
      "because there were no lights and the woods would be dark as hell. Going down\n",

      "him.\n",
      "JZ: So how far behind the lines would you say the field hospital was?\n",
      "WV: Probably four, five, depends.\n",
      "JZ: Tell me about some other stories you can remember.\n",
      "WV: What I wanted to tell you about Schevenhutte. From Liege, Belgium we went to\n",
      "a little town called Rochon. From Rochon we went through Soignies, now we\n",
      "traveled through Soignies at night and it was nothing but woods and a small road.\n",
      "We traveled all at night, when we were going to bed down when a battalion of\n",
      "Germans come walking through. Some were killed, some were wounded, and\n",
      "some got away. The Colonel said there was no use staying in the woods so we\n",
      "moved out and took the town of Schevenhutte. That night all hell broke loss. They\n",
      "sent a hell of a counterattack against us. There were Germans out the windows.\n",
      "17\n",
      "They were fought off and that took place for close to a month and we were cut off\n",
      "at one time. I was at headquarters where the Colonel was at when the Germans\n",
      "came along the road and he was calling on the radio for help from the First\n",
      "Division. He said I don’t know how long were going to be able to hold out. They\n",
      "held out, they fought them off. That took place every night. There was one night,\n",
      "about six o’clock at night, when a woman comes walking down the road through\n",
      "the lines. An infantry guy stopped her and took her back to headquarters and\n",
      "started questioning her and she said the Germans were going to attack at three\n",
      "o’clock in the morning. And the Colonel had a fifty caliber machine gun set up\n",
      "outside of the hill. And sure enough they came through and that night again all\n",
      "hell broke loose and very few of them got through. The ones that got through\n",
      "were killed later on. Any movement at all, there was a two story house with an\n",
      "attic window. We would have a guy up there, an observer. Evidently the Germans\n",
      "spotted him or saw movement up there they pulled their tank up and shot up in the\n",
      "window and blew him right away. In the same town of Schevenhutte in the end\n",
      "food was getting scarce for the civilians and things let up a little bit. From where\n",
      "we had aid station, across the road and down the field a little bit there was a\n",
      "grandfather, father and a five year old daughter in the building. The grandfather\n",
      "and the father were butchering a goat to eat and the German’s threw a mortar shell\n",
      "in there, killed the father and the grandfather and blew both the five year old girl’s\n",
      "legs off. We couldn’t get out with her, we kept her in the aid station and gave her\n",
      "blood plasma and took care of her. She was in pretty good shape as far as shock\n",
      "or anything like that goes. Three days later they were able to get out and take her\n",
      "to the field hospital. I always wondered what happened to her, if she made it.\n",
      "Well about five, ten years ago I was working for a German company, the owner\n",
      "of the company and the engineer came here. After we were done with our\n",
      "business, I said, I hate like hell to bring this up, and I told them about this little\n",
      "girl. The guy says to me, could you give me any names or anything. All I knew\n",
      "was the mayor’s name. The engineer says he went to school in Altin, and\n",
      "Schevenhutte was a resource town. He told me he was going to go up there and\n",
      "see if I can find out something and he did, he located her. She has two kids and\n",
      "18\n",
      "she is married and lives in the next town over. I had to go to Germany and this\n",
      "engineer says that when I come over he’ll take me over to meet her. Well, when I\n",
      "went to Germany he was in Africa and was suppose to fly back home but the\n",
      "airline was on strike and couldn’t get out of Africa so I didn’t get to go up.\n",
      "JZ: She survived the war.\n",
      "WV: And had two children. But I always wondered about her, did she make it. And she\n",
      "made it. Anyway, that’s the town that Lou was a machine gunner and was at an\n",
      "outpost and got shot in both legs. And Lou [LaCivita] and I were good friends.\n",
      "When he got hit, he was able to get on the phone and says to tell Doc, tell Doc\n",
      "that Poncho got hurt. They used to call me Doc. Well I got word and I was down\n",
      "the line a little bit that there was a wounded guy up there. This was two or three\n",
      "o’clock early morning. I had to alert people that I was coming because if not\n",
      "they’ll shoot you. Well, it took a little time because I called the one guy in the\n",
      "hole to pass to the next time that I was coming up. They were good at that; they\n",
      "would say, “Hey Doc’s coming up watch out for him.” Anyway I got up to\n",
      "Poncho, worked on him and patched him up and put two blanket splints on him\n",
      "and brought him down were the jeep could get him. I remember him complaining\n",
      "that he got hit and had two broken legs. I said, “Poncho, don’t complain. It’s bad\n",
      "you’re hit, don’t get me wrong you’re alive. You’re going back to the States.\n",
      "You’re going to be alright. He kept saying, yeah but with two broken legs.” I say\n",
      "it’s the best thing that happened to him. The next town is a town when you read\n",
      "about the Silver Star. It’s where all those guys were wounded. Now, would he\n",
      "have made it? Machine Gunners are out there shooting. Once they pick up the\n",
      "direction where you’re at they throw mortar shells in there and artillery shells.\n",
      "Machine gunners got to keep moving. He fires a lot here and change positions if\n",
      "not they’ll get him right away.\n",
      "JZ: Tell me about the next town because that was even worse.\n",
      "19\n",
      "WV: Gressenich was the next town, probably about four miles from Schevenhutte. The\n",
      "infantry was moving into Gressenich and there was a wooded area before you got\n",
      "into town. The Germans let us get into the woods and they threw a hell of a\n",
      "mortar and artillery shells. When you’re in a wooded area where there’s trees and\n",
      "stuff, even if you dig a fox hole you’re not protected because when that mortar\n",
      "hits the tree the burst comes down the hole. If you’re out in the field and hits the\n",
      "ground it’s not going down so you’re safe in the hole. We had a large number of\n",
      "wounded people there. We were putting five people on the jeep. The colonel\n",
      "came to me and says that we need to get these wounded guys out of here, what the\n",
      "hell is it going to take? I told him, all we had is a jeep. Get me a half track. He\n",
      "says you’ll have it there in ten minutes. Sure enough in ten minutes they brought\n",
      "a half track down there. Then we started loading them up and putting them in the\n",
      "half track. Even guys that should have been on stretchers we didn’t put on\n",
      "stretchers to make room to take more people out. As we left this wooded area\n",
      "come down, there was an open road for about a quarter to a half of mile. When we\n",
      "started down across that road that’s when they opened up on us. They could see\n",
      "you and with artillery and mortar shells they hammered the hell out of the road.\n",
      "We got them to the aid station and went back to get the rest of them.\n",
      "JZ: When was this?\n",
      "WV: Last part of September or first part of October probably of 1944.\n",
      "JZ: Afterwards you continued on?\n",
      "WV: Yeah, you kept moving up and after that was the Battle of the Bulge. We were\n",
      "north of the Bulge and that was during the winter with snow. We were out in the\n",
      "fields. The aid station had a tent up. We stayed there until that was over. I think\n",
      "at the Battle of the Bugle we were close to the town of Cologne, we had taken\n",
      "Cologne. Then we moved on and we were in Bonn, Germany when we got word\n",
      "of the Remagen Bridge across the Reine. They moved us down there and I would\n",
      "20\n",
      "say we were the probably with the first hundred men across the Remagen because\n",
      "we had an aid station right in that tunnel. There was a railroad tunnel there. The\n",
      "first day we had the aid station there, and then there was too much commotion\n",
      "with people coming across the bridge and everything else, the shooting and\n",
      "artillery shells coming in. So we moved up the road further and there was a house\n",
      "up there. So we put the aid station in the house. On top of the hill was the\n",
      "autobahn, big highway. From there we went to Camp Dachau, there were the\n",
      "political prisoners, the Jews. It’s when they have the crematories. We went\n",
      "through Camp Dachau but never stopped. We went to take the next town,\n",
      "Musberg. There was another infantry outfit. I think it was Forth Infantry that was\n",
      "at Camp Dachau for a day then the special forces came up to take care of the\n",
      "people of Camp Dachau.\n",
      "JZ: So you didn’t stop at Camp Dachau?\n",
      "WV: No, but let me say this, we took prisoners. We took the guards and whatever we\n",
      "could get there, but we moved on to the next town which was Musberg. It was\n",
      "Musberg that was a prisoner-of-war camp, that’s where the American soldiers\n",
      "were. We stayed in Musberg for about a week.\n",
      "JZ: So you were at Dachau, tell me about what you saw.\n",
      "WV: Well I saw the crematories where they had the ovens and where they burned\n",
      "them. They had a stretcher that was made out of metal and they would put a body\n",
      "in it and push them in and close the door. They also had the rooms of showers\n",
      "where they put gas in. They had dogs, we shot the dogs. Then there were trenches\n",
      "where they kept Jews that were dead and even some that were alive.\n",
      "JZ: Were there still other prisoners that were alive too?\n",
      "WV: Oh yeah there were prisoners, skinny as hell, nothing but bones.\n",
      "21\n",
      "JZ: Did you treat any of them?\n",
      "WV: We didn’t. Our goal was to get to Musberg because there was a prisoners-of-war\n",
      "camp there with American there. We had orders to move on. There was an outfit\n",
      "that came up behind us, I think the Fourth Infantry, and they’re the ones that took\n",
      "care of the rest of the prisoners there. Special Forces came in to take care of the\n",
      "people that were in the prison camps.\n",
      "JZ: So these were Special Forces, special soldiers.\n",
      "WV: They were medics. They used to buy the soldiers.\n",
      "JZ: What was your reaction when you saw the camp?\n",
      "WV: It was awful, we couldn’t believe it. I heard two years back someone on\n",
      "television said that the Holocaust never took place. Well I said how stupid can the\n",
      "guy be. I saw it, and I know it took place. It was pitiful what they did to those\n",
      "poor people, they should all be shot. Sometimes we would take a town and the\n",
      "Germans would have someone hanging from a post or tree.\n",
      "JZ: Tell me about when you got to Musberg, the American POW camp. Tell me about\n",
      "that.\n",
      "WV: Well we took the town of Musberg. Some of the people I talked to, I was trying to\n",
      "find out if anyone was from Pennsylvania. Hell, they were happy as hell. They put\n",
      "some people from one of the companies to guard them, and a kitchen crew to feed\n",
      "them. They were there too long; I’m going to say three days at most then they\n",
      "would move the prisoners out of there.\n",
      "JZ: How many American POWs were there?\n",
      "22\n",
      "WV: Oh, I don’t know, quite a bit.\n",
      "JZ: In general, what was the condition like?\n",
      "WV: Fairly good. Much better than the Jews. The Jews were totally abused. They\n",
      "weren’t treated well and that’s the biggest thing. A lot of the Germans were trying\n",
      "to take off when we got there.\n",
      "JZ: Oh, the guards?\n",
      "WV: Yeah the guards. In fact after I ended up in Elbe River waiting for the Russians, I\n",
      "went back to that camp. That camp, they ended up putting the German soldiers\n",
      "there.\n",
      "JZ: What did they do, just put them in a camp?\n",
      "WV: Yeah, the ones that they had information they would put in special camps.\n",
      "JZ: You said you got to the Elbe River?\n",
      "WV: We got to the Elbe River and waited for the Russians and waited for the Russians\n",
      "there. Now I never saw the Russians because we were there for awhile then they\n",
      "moved the battalion down to Linz, Austria because there was suppose to be S.S.\n",
      "in the mountain but there wasn’t. A couple days after the war ended I was on my\n",
      "way home. I got onto the train. I don’t know how many days it took us because\n",
      "every time another train was coming they would put us aside. We ended up in a\n",
      "camp in France. I spent a week in France then got on the ship and came home.\n",
      "When I was on the ship coming home is when they announced the war ended in\n",
      "Japan. We were scheduled to come home for thirty days, then retraining, then\n",
      "Japan.\n",
      "23\n",
      "JZ: Oh wow. So you said you didn’t have a rifle. Did you have to fire, use a gun\n",
      "occasionally?\n",
      "WV: At night I carried a pistol. During the day they didn’t want us to show guns with\n",
      "the arm band on.\n",
      "JZ: Why was that because of the Red Cross?\n",
      "WV: Number one, the Red Cross and, number two, because if you’re going to have a\n",
      "rifle you’re going to start shooting and not paying attention to the wounded guy.\n",
      "JZ: They wanted all your attention on the wounded guy.\n",
      "WV: Right, on the wounded guy. During the Battle of the Bulge at night we all laid\n",
      "with guns.\n",
      "JZ: The worse time when you probably had the most causalities would be during the\n",
      "Bulge, would that be correct?\n",
      "WV: No, I would say the worst causalities were when we were at Saint Lo. And those\n",
      "hedge rows, those guys would come in at ten o’clock morning and by one o’clock\n",
      "someone was dead or wounded. They would try to take care of everyone that\n",
      "came in. The bad thing was the mortar and artillery shells.\n",
      "JZ: I don’t know if you would like to talk about your service and how you were\n",
      "recommended for the Silver Star.\n",
      "WV: No, I don’t.\n",
      "JZ: You don’t want to speak about that?\n",
      "24\n",
      "WV: No, I don’t think too much about it.\n",
      "JZ: Is there a reason why?\n",
      "WV: Well I got out of the service and this thing was at home, my dad had it with a\n",
      "letter telling me to send it to the Veteran’s Administration for review and\n",
      "approval. I said, I have been in the service and this is sent here. Why didn’t they\n",
      "do it? What took place was my captain at that time, and he was a medical doctor,\n",
      "at battalion surgery. He got promoted to regimental surgeon. One day he was\n",
      "coming up in a jeep to bring us supplies and see if we needed anything. One of\n",
      "our planes shot and killed him. I got the call to go up there, that a jeep was turned\n",
      "over and on fire. I went up there and with these bars that they had with the\n",
      "stretchers, I put a rope on it and pulled it up and he was under. He was shot\n",
      "through the back. I guess when they went through his personal stuff they found\n",
      "this was and sent it to my home address. They didn’t know where I was at. All\n",
      "they had to do was call regiment at and ask where I was but instead they sent it\n",
      "home. I said, what the hell good is it? Nothing.\n",
      "JZ: When you came home, how did you adapt to civilian life?\n",
      "WV: When I first came home to be honest with you, I was drinking a little bit. I think\n",
      "everybody that came home, every time a new guy came home that you went to\n",
      "school with or were friends with you went to the bar and had a few drinks. I was\n",
      "home a month and I told my dad I wanted to go to work. So he got me a job in the\n",
      "coal mine. The way we were drinking, all the GIs that came home at that time\n",
      "were drinking pretty heavy, so I went to work in the mine. I had to be up five\n",
      "o’clock in the morning so I couldn’t be out drinking too damn much. It’s the best\n",
      "thing that happened.\n",
      "JZ: Did you every face any discrimination because you were Italian?\n",
      "25\n",
      "WV: No. First of all I wouldn’t take it and no I never had a problem. Let me say this to\n",
      "you, back in the olden days, I’m going back to the thirties, guy would call me a\n",
      "dago. I would call him a Pollock or something. Even the blacks, there was never a\n",
      "problem. In this town we didn’t have a lot of blacks but the blacks we had were\n",
      "never a problem. I didn’t know what they were going through but in the thirties\n",
      "they had a hell of a life in Masontown. Now me not going through that, I didn’t\n",
      "face that. Now in this town, there used to be Ku Klux, but they never bothered us.\n",
      "JZ: Did the war change your life? Did it make you grow up more? Did it give you a\n",
      "new perspective on life?\n",
      "WV: No, the only thing with the training I had and after I came back and worked in the\n",
      "coal mine. When I first came home I was loading coal by hand. You got paid for\n",
      "the coal you put in the wagon. Then that mine closed and I went to work for\n",
      "U.S.Steel. Being a medic and the training I had, the chief safety director asked if\n",
      "I would get on the rescue team. I didn’t even know what rescue team was, but I\n",
      "said yes. That was the best move I made because that’s were I learned everything\n",
      "about the coal mines. Every time there were classes or new equipment coming in\n",
      "they would send me to it and that’s where I got my education about coal mining.\n",
      "JZ: Would you say some of your medical training and the army helped out?\n",
      "WV: Yeah because they knew I was medic in the army they wanted me with the rescue\n",
      "team. Even later on I would, I used to train fire companies with their different\n",
      "equipment. In fact I just resigned two weeks ago, for twenty-five years I was on\n",
      "the board of directors for the EMT. I was also on the board at Pittsburgh at the\n",
      "EMSI which is made up of fourteen counties. Emergency Medical Service\n",

      "FOREWORD\n",
      "J. Samuel Walker\n",
      "In Radium City, Joel Lubenau and Edward Landa trace two prominent and intersecting\n",
      "themes. The first is a little-known but important chapter in the local history of Pittsburgh and the\n",
      "surrounding region of southwestern Pennsylvania. The other is the history of the early radium\n",
      "industry in the United States. The production and sale of radium began with wildly inflated\n",
      "hopes about the benefits the element provided that gradually gave way to recognition of the\n",
      "serious health hazards it presented.\n",
      "For obvious reasons, Pittsburgh earned its nicknames of “Iron City,” “Steel City,” and,\n",
      "during the 1970s, “City of Champions.” But the origins of the title of “Radium City” that it\n",
      "acquired in the early twentieth century are far less apparent, and Lubenau and Landa explain\n",
      "clearly how that label came about. It was the result of the entrepreneurial skills and daring of two\n",
      "brothers raised in Pittsburgh, James J. and Joseph M. Flannery. They abandoned their family’s\n",
      "undertaking business to build two industries virtually from scratch. The first was the mining,\n",
      "milling, and smelting of vanadium, a key ingredient in making lighter and stronger steel. The\n",
      "Flannerys founded a firm, the American Vanadium Company, that was headquartered in\n",
      "Pittsburgh and housed downtown in an elegant five-story building.\n",
      "The Flannerys’ experience with vanadium production was a prelude to the formation of\n",
      "the Standard Chemical Company, whose purpose was to find, mine, extract, and market radium.\n",
      "When their sister was diagnosed with cancer, Joseph Flannery undertook a sustained but\n",
      "ultimately futile attempt to combat her illness by acquiring radium in Europe, the only source of\n",
      "supply at the time. The tiny amount of radium that was available in the United States convinced\n",
      "him to establish a company to produce the element in sufficient quantities to meet demand for\n",
      "medical and other applications.\n",
      "Radium had been first identified as an element in 1898 by Marie and Pierre Curie. The\n",
      "news of the Curies’ discovery set off a wave of articles, books, and lectures that claimed an\n",
      "abundance of potential uses for the new element, some realistic and many others fanciful.\n",
      "Physicians quickly recognized that radium could be an important advance in treating cancer, but\n",
      "the legitimate benefits were soon overshadowed by many indiscriminate and ill-informed\n",
      "applications, such as injections or consumption of radium solutions for acne, sexual disfunction,\n",
      "and heart disease. The radium craze greatly increased demand for the element, and Joseph\n",
      "Flannery’s company built a state-of-the-art plant in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, to extract the\n",
      "element from ore. The Canonsburg facility succeeded in substantially increasing the supply of\n",
      "radium in the United States and abroad.\n",
      "The risks of exposure to radium became evident only gradually, in part because the most\n",
      "serious dangers are insidious. Radium is an “internal emitter” that causes its greatest harm if\n",
      "taken into the body, including severe anemia and other life-threatening afflictions. During the\n",
      "1920s, the hazards had become apparent enough that professional societies strongly\n",
      "recommended the adoption of protective measures against the improper use of radium.\n",
      "6\n",
      "By that time, the Standard Chemical Company, largely because of competition from\n",
      "cheaper suppliers, had ceased production of radium. Eventually, it was sold at a fraction of its\n",
      "former value.\n",
      "Radium City is a history of the technical, scientific, business, social, public health, and\n",
      "personal aspects of a once-thriving industry. As such, it makes for an engaging story that the\n",
      "authors admirably bring to light.\n",
      "J. Samuel Walker is the author of Permissible Dose: A History of Radiation Protection in the\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "In 1921, Marie Curie, recipient of Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry and co-\n",
      "discoverer of radium, visited the United States to receive a gift of one gram of radium from the\n",
      "women of America. Costing $100,000, the gift was presented to her by President Harding at the\n",
      "White House in a ceremony widely covered by the press. The Standard Chemical Company\n",
      "(SCC), a Pittsburgh enterprise founded by James J. and Joseph M. Flannery, produced the\n",
      "radium. After receiving the gift, Marie Curie travelled to western Pennsylvania where she was\n",
      "toured SCC’s ore processing and radium refining plants.\n",
      "Radium City is the story of how the two brothers, undertakers-turned-industrialists,\n",
      "founded the first and largest American company to produce radium and of the company’s\n",
      "legacies. It begins not with radium, but another once-rare metal, vanadium. Their purchase of a\n",
      "company manufacturing specialized bolts for steam locomotives led to inquiries about improving\n",
      "the steel used to make the bolts. The answer was a rare metal, vanadium; adding small quantities\n",
      "to steel greatly improved its structural properties. They acquired control of the world’s largest,\n",
      "richest vanadium ore body – in Peru – and set about creating a company, the American\n",
      "Vanadium Company (AVC) to mine the ore, ship it to western Pennsylvania where it was\n",
      "processed to extract the vanadium, and develop methods to make vanadium steel. Known as the\n",
      "“miracle alloy,” vanadium steel made possible Henry Ford’s Model T automobile and was\n",
      "widely used in building the Panama Canal. The AVC was made possible by a team of technical\n",
      "specialists assembled by the brothers. They had a genius for finding and hiring scientists,\n",
      "metallurgists, engineers, and plant managers having the requisite knowledge and experience to\n",
      "make AVC a technological and financial success. The AVC became the blueprint for the SCC.\n",
      "The brothers’ interest in radium arose when their sister was stricken with cancer. At the\n",
      "time, there were only three American physicians experienced in using radium, none in\n",
      "Pittsburgh. To obtain radium, one had to go Europe; but even there it was scarce. The brothers\n",
      "elected to produce radium in the U.S. Once again, they had to create a team of scientists,\n",
      "chemists, engineers, and managers plus physicians and pharmacists, this time to produce radium\n",
      "for medical use.\n",
      "In Europe, chemical supply houses produced radium as a sideline. SCC was the first\n",
      "company devoted solely to the production of radium. If the SCC was to succeed financially, the\n",
      "brothers needed to create a domestic market for medical radium. This led to an innovative\n",
      "approach combining an extensive in-house medical radium research program, carried out by\n",
      "physicians and pharmacists, with a vigorous marketing effort to inform the American medical\n",
      "community about radium. Commercial production of radium began in January 1913.\n",
      "As 1913 ended, the brothers faced a threat from an unexpected quarter, the federal\n",
      "government. The Progressive wing of Congress and the Department of Interior were pushing for\n",
      "government control of mineral resources; in the case of radium, this involved withdrawing public\n",
      "lands bearing ore containing radium from commercial claims. This would be a disaster for the\n",
      "SCC. Further, the U.S. Bureau of Mines entered a cooperative agreement with a private\n",
      "8\n",
      "organization that eventually engaged in radium production in competition with SCC. House and\n",
      "Senate hearings were held, but they were overshadowed by press coverage of the use of radium\n",
      "to treat a huge tumor on the shoulder of a member of Congress, Rep. Robert G. Bremner of New\n",
      "Jersey. The treatment was unsuccessful and Bremner died during the hearings. To the relief of\n",
      "the Flannery brothers, Congress failed to pass legislation withdrawing public lands bearing ore\n",
      "containing radium from commercial claims.\n",
      "But 1914 brought more bad news. Most of SCC’s radium was sold in Europe because the\n",
      "domestic market was so small. With the start of World War I, European demand for radium\n",
      "dropped sharply, forcing SCC to cut back production. In response, SCC redoubled its efforts to\n",
      "grow a domestic market for medical radium. The war, however, created a new market for radium\n",
      "— luminescent paint for military items such as compasses, watches, gun sights, and dials and\n",
      "instruments on naval vessels and aircraft. By the war’s end, SCC was a financial as well as a\n",
      "technological success.\n",
      "In 1920, the brothers both passed away. James C. Gray, the brothers’ longtime legal\n",
      "counsel, was elected president of the SCC. By 1921, SCC had produced over half of the world’s\n",
      "radium. This was a remarkable achievement given that radium had been discovered only 23\n",
      "years earlier and that SCC had been producing radium a mere 8 years. Radium production by\n",
      "SCC ended in 1922 when cheaper radium produced from much richer ore from the Belgian\n",
      "Congo became available from Belgium.\n",
      "SCC was an extraordinary commercial enterprise. Radium production was America’s\n",
      "first nuclear industry. The production and utilization of radium — a radioactive decay product of\n",
      "uranium — was the forerunner of today’s production and utilization of uranium for nuclear\n",
      "energy.\n",
      "When SCC began, there were only three radium therapists in the U.S.; but by mid-20th\n",
      "century there were 3,600 radium therapists, growth that was initiated by SCC. By that time,\n",
      "radioactive materials produced in accelerators and nuclear reactors offered alternatives to radium\n",
      "and more choices in treatment modalities. Radium therapists, already knowledgeable about\n",
      "using radiation from radium, were prepared to utilize them. Medical radium paved the way to\n",
      "today’s use of radioactive material in nuclear medicine and radiation therapy. That is a\n",
      "significant, lasting legacy of the Flannery brothers’ radium company.\n",
      "But there were other legacies. For some of its leading scientists, there were tragic health\n",
      "consequences resulting from their working with radium but not knowing radium’s dangers — an\n",
      "example of technology outpacing understanding of the technology’s risks to health. An\n",
      "unanticipated and unwanted legacy was environmental contamination — the radioactive residues\n",
      "of the mining and milling of ore in Colorado, the radioactive tailings from the extraction of\n",
      "radium from the ore in Pennsylvania, and radioactive contamination of the building where the\n",
      "radium was refined. Remediating these sites would prove controversial, took decades to\n",
      "accomplish, cost millions of dollars, and required government intervention.\n",
      "What follows is a story of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine\n",
      "utilized in an innovative commercial enterprise to produce and promote radium for medical\n",
      "9\n",
      "purposes. It is an account of the first use of radioactive material in medicine, the role of scientific\n",
      "and medical research to promote its utilization, the effects of radiation on worker health and the\n",
      "environment, and the government’s role in these matters. It is about a time when Pittsburgh,\n",
      "known as the iron and steel city, was once called, “Radium City.”\n",
      "10\n",
      "Chapter 1: Vanadium\n",
      "“A better and lighter car.”\n",
      "In a special act passed by the Pennsylvania legislature in 1816 Pittsburgh, then a borough,\n",
      "became a city, the first in western Pennsylvania.1 Even at this early date manufacturing was\n",
      "eclipsing agriculture within the city. An 1817 enumeration of businesses included iron\n",
      "foundries, blacksmiths, book binders, brewers, copper and tinsmiths, cabinet makers, nail\n",
      "manufacturers, printers, shoe and boot makers, tanners, wagon makers, and weavers. The 259\n",
      "businesses employed 1,637 workers. Two years later, mechanics and manufacturers organized\n",
      "the Pittsburgh Manufacturing Association to promote local industry. The 1820 U.S. census\n",
      "counted 7,248 persons living in Pittsburgh. The city was bounded on the north and south sides\n",
      "by the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers which joined at the city’s western tip to form the\n",
      "Ohio River. The Allegheny was first bridged in 1818 and the Monongahela in 1819. Plans to\n",
      "supply city water were first proposed in 1818 and by 1828 river water was supplied to city\n",
      "residents and businesses. In 1834, the state legislature established a general system of education\n",
      "and provided funds to establish public schools. Following elections in Pittsburgh to elect school\n",
      "district directors the city opened its first public schools.\n",
      "The first canal boat arrived in 1829 and beginning in 1834 freight and passengers could\n",
      "travel by canal boat between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, the boats traveling partly by canals and\n",
      "carried across the Allegheny mountains on an innovative portage railroad.2 River commerce built\n",

      "and del Rio withdrew it. In 1831 the Swedish physician and chemist Nils Gabriel Sefström\n",
      "14\n",
      "isolated an oxide of a new element when working with iron ores. Because of its colorful\n",
      "compounds, he named it vanadium for the Scandinavian goddess of love and beauty, Freyja the\n",
      "Vanadis. Also, in 1831 the German chemist Friedrich Wöhler came into possession of del Rio’s\n",
      "brown lead and confirmed his discovery of vanadium, but Sefström’s name for the element,\n",
      "vanadium, remained.\n",
      "Vanadium is widely distributed in the earth’s crust but does not readily form ore deposits.\n",
      "Because supplies of vanadium were limited it was costly, for example, in 1892, vanadium was\n",
      "priced at $4,792 per pound.34 Consequently, its use was restricted to experimental work. In 1896,\n",

      "Oliver Arnold, Professor of Metallurgy, University College of Sheffield, conducted additional\n",
      "tests of vanadium steel.37 In 1904, H. Riall Sankey and J. Kent Smith published a comprehensive\n",

      "whether the cans were shielded. Absent information to the contrary, the cans were probably\n",
      "unshielded. Trolleys similar to those used during period SCC was using them have been\n",

      "American Mining Congress at their annual convention in Philadelphia.\n",
      "Entitled “Our Radium Resources,” he began his talk by noting that almost all of the\n",
      "carnotite mined in 1912 had been shipped abroad and that the Colorado carnotite was furnishing\n",
      "three times as much radium as the rest of the world. He asserted there was a large waste in\n",
      "mining carnotite because low-grade ores that were relegated to dumps would have economic\n",
      "value if they were mechanically concentrated. Parsons pointed out there was a large gap between\n",
      "the money paid in Europe for the ore and the money paid to American miners. To close the gap\n",
      "he offered two options, holding U.S. ore for a higher price or manufacturing radium in America.\n",

      "meant not from use but from exploitation by private parties and developing the ores for the\n",
      "“service of the people of the United States.”260 If passed by Congress, the practical effect of the\n",
      "proposal would be an end to filing radium mining claims on federal lands. Existing claims would\n",
      "be honored, but new claims would be subject to control by the Secretary of the Interior with the\n",
      "objective of securing a supply of radium “for the use of the Government of the United States and\n",

      "byproducts of radium extraction and Flannery explained their potential value. Another byproduct\n",

      "There was a ready market for vanadium as an alloying metal to harden and strengthen\n",

      "SCC’s bottom line. Indeed, four years later during WWI at a May 2, 1918 hearing of the Senate\n",
      "Committee on Mines and Mining on Minerals and Metals for War Purposes, Flannery testified\n",
      "that SCC was “selling 100 per cent of our vanadium.”310\n",

      "finding markets for uranium in his House testimony, “We have on our hands now probably\n",

      "nineteenth century, European armament manufacturers looked at uranium as an alloying metal to\n",
      "increase tensile strength and hardness of steel and by 1902 their interest sparked a surge in\n",
      "prospecting and mining of vanadium ores in southwestern Colorado.313 But subsequent\n",
      "metallurgical research in Europe disclosed that other alloying metals such as tungsten could\n",
      "impart similar effects at a lower cost and interest in uranium as an alloying metal diminished.\n",
      "80\n",
      "World War I brought a renewed interest in uranium-steel alloys fueled by rumors that Germany\n",
      "was using uranium steel to increase the rapid-fire capability and accuracy of large gun barrels. In\n",
      "conjunction with the Army and Navy, the USBM sponsored research programs to assess the\n",
      "value of making uranium steel armaments. One problem that came to light was the difficulty of\n",

      "the alloy failed to show it had any merit beyond existing alloys. Once again, interest in uranium-\n",

      "another patent for a uranium iron alloy.317 Flannery also sought outside help. In October 1918, he\n",

      "By1916 Flannery was selling ferro-uranium alloys to specialty-steel alloy manufacturers\n",

      "inhibitor if the exposure is too prolonged. In 1913, Colorado State Commissioner of Mines\n",
      "Thomas R. Henahen touted the state’s uranium ore for making fertilizer.322 In February 1914,\n",
      "during the U.S. Senate Hearings on radium Flannery extolled the value of radium fertilizer:\n",
      "Radioactive sand, as it comes from our concentrating plant, when given to the farmer and\n",
      "mixed with his fertilizer and used in the ground, is very effective and valuable as a\n",
      "catalyzer. It tones the seed. If the seed is a little anemic or mediocre it brings it up to the\n",
      "normal of the fertilizer. I have had the pleasure of working in some of this material, and\n",
      "in tobacco we have got a 75 per cent increase; in wheat 65 per cent; in corn, 250 per cent;\n",
      "50 per cent in cabbage. The smallest amount of this material being mixed with the\n",
      "fertilizer affects the seed. You get a thousand pounds of this material and it can be sold\n",
      "at a price to the farmer which will be ridiculously low.323\n",
      "81\n",
      "The potential value of such fertilizer was the subject of two field studies. In the spring of\n",
      "1913, the University of Illinois Agricultural Experiment Station began field experiments with\n",
      "radium fertilizer supplied by SCC.324 The study was led by University of Illinois Professor Cyril\n",
      "G. Hopkins, Chief in Agronomy and Chemistry, and Ward H. Sachs, Associate in Chemistry.\n",

      "radium on plant growth dating from 1908 and concluded that while the studies indicated high\n",
      "levels of exposure to radium were “toxic” to plant life, small amounts were “healthfully\n",
      "stimulating.” He thought that overall the results called for more testing –- by him.\n",
      "Rusby’s experiments began with a winter culture of radishes in a greenhouse and with\n",
      "seedlings in window boxes in his home. The studies were then scaled-up, with field crops grown\n",
      "at a farm in Northfield, Ohio, fruits and vegetables grown at “an experimental garden in\n",
      "Pittsburgh” (in fact, the garden of Joseph Flannery’s home), and a 1.5-acre plot in Nutley, New\n",
      "Jersey. Rusby’s crops included radishes, potatoes, celery, various beans, parsnips, peas, onions,\n",
      "peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, carrots, eggplants, various melons, corn, spinach, squash,\n",
      "cabbage, and pumpkins. He reported:\n",
      "“[T]he yield of most crops can be increased by the addition of some amount of [radium\n",
      "fertilizer], the amounts differing with different crops. The beneficial effects continue over\n",
      "successive crops, probably for several years. The largest amount required by any crop\n",
      "would cost less than the increased market value of such crop of the first year...Radium is\n",
      "not a plant food. The necessity for fertilizer is but little decreased by its use. The fertility\n",
      "of unused ground will spontaneously increase at a much greater rate when treated with\n",
      "radium” (figures 7.4 - 7.6).328\n",
      "In January 1915, the University of Illinois Agricultural Experiment Station issued a\n",
      "report by Hopkins and Sachs on their studies. They rebutted Rusby’s claims having found that\n",
      "natural variations, rather than the radium, may have caused the differences that Rusby reported\n",
      "82\n",
      "and noting that in some cases the increases reported by Rusby were “found only by selecting the\n",
      "highest results from rather discordant data.” They concluded that the “well-informed farmer on\n",
      "the common Illinois land…will not waste his money on so-called ‘complete’ fertilizers, nor on\n",
      "new advertised soil or crop stimulants.”\n",
      "Nonetheless, SCC could not have asked for a more favorable and more public\n",
      "endorsement of its fertilizer than Rusby’s article in the The New York Times. It was followed in\n",
      "1915 by a blitz of radium fertilizer advertisements in American horticultural and gardening\n",
      "magazines, e.g. House and Garden, The Garden Magazine, The Florists Review, Country Life in\n",

      "it would annually ship 75,000 tons of the radium-infused fertilizer, the tonnage representing a\n",
      "standard brand of commercial fertilizer to which tailings were added.330 The product, labeled\n",
      "“Radium Brand Fertilizer,” was promoted by another SCC subsidiary, Radium Fertilizer\n",
      "Company.\n",
      "The disagreement regarding the value of fertilizer continued. In April 1915, Rusby\n",
      "republished his conclusions in Scientific American Supplement that was followed by rebuttals by\n",
      "Hopkins and Sachs in Science in May. 331 Then, in August R. R. Ramsey, an Associate Professor\n",
      "of Physics, at Indiana University, weighed in pointing out the amount of radium added to soil by\n",
      "the fertilizer was miniscule relative to the amount of radium naturally present in soil.332 In\n",
      "October, editors of the Journal of the American Medical Association joined the debate. After\n",
      "summarizing the work of Rusby, Hopkins and Sachs, and Ramsey, the editors concluded, “It\n",

      "agriculture. At present, however, the best evidence we have does not encourage us to regard this\n",
      "as an immediate possibility.” 333\n",
      "At least one commercial nursery in Canonsburg was a customer. Many years later,\n",
      "during the remediation of the SCC Canonsburg plant site, state and federal officials identified the\n",
      "former nursery as one of 163 off-site locations where contaminated materials traceable to the site\n",
      "had to be removed. James G. Yusko, the state regional health physicist overseeing the cleanup,\n",

      "their attention and reports of injuries published in scientific and medical journals added to their\n",
      "knowledge.\n",
      "An early example of SCC’s naive practices occurred in 1913 when SCC sold 500\n",
      "milligrams of radium to Great Britain for hospital use. Otto Brill personally delivered the radium,\n",
      "carrying it in his vest pocket when leaving Pennsylvania.414 Carrying 500 milligrams of radium\n",
      "this way would have risked injury even if carried only for a short period of time. Perhaps Brill\n",
      "was injured because later that year when another shipment was made overseas, it was handled\n",
      "differently. On that occasion SCC, prepared 250 milligrams of radium to be sent to Brill who had\n",
      "returned to Austria. Since the radium was deemed too valuable to be sent by mail (which was\n",
      "allowable at the time), SCC sent the radium via a messenger, an employee. The radium was\n",
      "contained in a wrapper small enough to be again carried in a vest pocket but this was now\n",
      "considered unsafe. So, “it was tucked carefully away in a corner of a suitcase.”415 Given the\n",
      "apparent absence of any significant shielding and assuming the suitcase had been carried by the\n",
      "messenger and kept in his stateroom while crossing the Atlantic, this improvement in radiation\n",
      "protection was an incremental one at best.\n",
      "The following year saw a much larger overseas delivery of radium. SCC tasked a\n",
      "chemist, Glenn Donald Kammer, with delivering four grams of radium, valued at almost half a\n",
      "million dollars, to England. On August 1, 1914 he sailed for England carrying the shipment in a\n",
      "valise (figure 9.2). It was similar to the medical valises carried by physicians when they made\n",
      "house calls. The amount of shielding would have been minimal because otherwise it would have\n",
      "been too heavy to carry. Given the value of its contents, the valise should have been checked\n",
      "with the ship’s purser for safekeeping but it is not certain Kammer did this. If, instead, he stowed\n",
      "the valise in his stateroom, he would have received additional radiation exposure.\n",
      "While in England Kammer wrote to Viol informing him of his technical discussions with\n",
      "English scientists. He also conveyed warnings from them about the radiation exposures of\n",
      "himself, Viol, and others at SCC:\n",
      "Let Miller [Arthur L. Miller, Viol’s assistant] weigh some of the tubes as you will expose\n",
      "yourself too much. They held up their hands in horror here when I told them what I have\n",
      "done with radium. Marsden [Rutherford’s associate] said “You have done a life’s work.”\n",
      "A Radium Institute man warned ‘watch out in four or five years from now’ and Doctor\n",

      "chances you take.”416\n",
      "Meanwhile, in June 1914, SCC published in its house journal Radium a summary of a\n",
      "report from the Radium Institute for Biologic-Therapeutic Research in Berlin of twelve cases of\n",
      "occupational injuries from working with radioactive substances for “long periods.” Injuries\n",
      "included changes in blood parameters and damage to the skin of fingertips.417 With respect to\n",
      "skin changes, the authors speculated they might lead to permanent injuries similar to those seen\n",
      "in x-ray burns and concluded:\n",
      "For this reason severe burns are to be carefully avoided, and apparatus for use in the\n",
      "application of radium should be designed with a view to requiring the least possible\n",
      "handling in the course of preparation for use on the patient. Long pincers should be used\n",
      "whenever possible instead of grasping the tube or preparation with the fingers. In\n",
      "factories the general disturbances may be avoided by: 1. Very good ventilation to remove\n",
      "the emanation [radon]; 2. Protecting the body by using metal plates on the tables to\n",
      "absorb the rays; 3. Short working hours and frequent vacations or change of occupation;\n",
      "4. Repeated and careful observation by a physician, especially of the blood picture, which\n",
      "should be observed at least twice a year.418\n",
      "In March 1916 Radium reprinted an illustrated article by Dr. Thomas Ordway on\n",
      "occupational injuries caused by radium that was originally published in the Journal of the\n",
      "American Medical Association.419 Ordway recounted his observations of the precautions taken\n",
      "and the injuries he saw while he was in London, Vienna, and Germany for clinical studies. He\n",
      "then presented details of cases observed at the Huntington Hospital in Boston, accompanied by\n",
      "illustrations of the injuries, and commented:\n",
      "From this it will be seen that injurious local effects were anticipated so that the changes\n",
      "to be described were not acquitted unwittingly but in spite of precaution. The increasing\n",
      "use of large quantities of radium warrants a detailed description and record of these\n",
      "changes not only because of the annoyance and discomfiture caused, but also as a\n",
      "warning from analogy to the Roentgen ray of more serious late effects such as atrophy,\n",
      "intractable ulceration and even cancer. Already in certain instances there have been\n",
      "caused not only great annoyance from discomfit but actual impairment in performing\n",
      "delicate manipulations because of the persistent local anesthetic effects....These\n",
      "symptoms occurred very insidiously, and consisted of blunting of the finger-tips,\n",
      "parathesia, such as increased sensitivity to heat and pressure, amounting at times to actual\n",
      "pain, and anesthesia of varying degrees….Each assistant and nurse before engaging in the\n",
      "clinical application of radium was warned of the annoying and possible dangerous\n",
      "effects, and told not to handle the active tubes of emanation [radon] with the fingers but\n",
      "to make use of forceps. In spite of this, a certain amount of handling was unavoidable in\n",
      "changing the radium tubes for suitable filtration and protection in difficult cases (figure\n",

      "102\n",
      "The Boston hospital devised forceps and special vises to minimize contact of fingers with\n",
      "sources, added shielding, and instituted special procedures to minimize exposure. Other changes\n",
      "were shortening staff’s work hours, periodically rotating them to other duties, and for those\n",
      "involved in preparation and use of radon sources, improving ventilation of their workplace.\n",
      "Periodic physical examinations with emphasis on blood work were instituted.421\n",
      "In summary, Ordway found that while acute reactions to radium were well known, e.g.\n",
      "burns, intermittent exposures over a prolonged period caused late health effects, a significant\n",
      "finding.\n",
      "Ordway’s article in Radium was followed by an article by Viol describing forceps he\n",
      "designed for handling radium tubes to reduce exposures of the fingertips.422 But the article’s\n",
      "most interesting aspect was Viol’s account of SCC’s earliest radiation safety practices and the\n",
      "reasons for them (or their lack) that echoed Ordway:\n",
      "The writer has had occasion to handle radium tubes very frequently in the past three\n",
      "years. In this time about fourteen grams of radium have been produced in the Radium\n",
      "Research Laboratory of the Standard Chemical Company and most of the radium has\n",
      "been supplied in tubes and applicators for radium therapy. At the outset little information\n",
      "was available as to methods for handling the material and with a realization of the great\n",
      "value of the material being handled and with no exact idea of the dangers involved, it was\n",
      "the custom at first to handle the tubes with the bare hands [emphasis added]. This was\n",
      "soon found to be disastrous, resulting in the production of typical radium burns on the\n",
      "ends of thumbs and forefingers.423\n",
      "At SCC, one of the most hazardous procedures to workers’ hands was “tubing” — the\n",
      "filling of capsules (tubes) with radium salt (figure 5.10). After sealing them, they were assayed.\n",
      "This was another hazardous process because the measurements required additional handling of\n",
      "the sources.\n",
      "With respect to the value of using forceps, Viol estimated that when handling a capsule\n",
      "with bare fingers the radium is less than half a millimeter from the skin, the thickness of the\n",
      "capsule wall. If the source is moved five hundred millimeters from the skin, the source is one\n",
      "thousand times distant from the skin and the intensity reduced by a factor of one million.424†\n",
      "Viol’s forceps helped reduce radiation exposure of the fingers, but even when using the forceps,\n",
      "the tips of the fingers were still in close proximity with the radium salt (figures 9.4 & 9.5). Viol\n",
      "reported that since instituting use of the modified forceps in late 1913, 500 glass capsules\n",
      "† Viol’s calculation was based on the “Inverse Square Law.” Increasing the distance from a\n",
      "radiation source reduces the radiation exposure. The reduction factor is the inverse of the square\n",
      "of the increase. Increasing the distance by a factor of 2 reduces the exposure by the inverse of 2\n",
      "times 2 -— one-forth. Increasing the distance by another factor of two reduces the exposure by\n",
      "the inverse of 2 times 2 times 2 — one-eighth. Viol’s forceps increased the distance by a factor\n",
      "of 1000 so the exposure reduction was the inverse of 1000 times 1000 — one-millionth.\n",

      "containing radium were handled repeatedly with only one incident of breakage that occurred\n",
      "when an inexperienced assistant handled a source.\n",
      "In 1921, in the lead article in the July-August issue of Radium, SCC summarized what\n",
      "was known about the dangers of radium and x-rays.425 Note was taken of the deaths of three\n",
      "workers at the London Radium Institute, in 1916, 1920 and 1921 respectively. Only the first was\n",
      "directly attributable to a disease associated with radiation exposure (pernicious anemia).\n",
      "Infective endocarditis and acute pneumonia were the causes of the other deaths but the institute’s\n",
      "medical committee felt it probable that the workers’ radiation exposures had weakened their\n",
      "resistance to the diseases. A study was made of the blood of every worker at the Institute “from\n",
      "the superintendent down to the hall porters.” The study found exposure to radium resulted in\n",
      "changes in red and white blood cell counts that correlated with their exposure to radium.\n",
      "Additional measures to protect workers from exposure were put in place with the result that a\n",
      "year later, blood conditions were generally returning to normal. Experimental exposures of rats\n",
      "to increasing amounts of radiation from radium was found to result in reductions of the\n",
      "production of red blood cells, findings that confirmed the view that the effects found among\n",
      "radium workers were caused by exposure to radium. 426 Reports from the Radium Institute in\n",
      "Paris, the Cancer Commission of Harvard University, the Howard A. Kelly Hospital in\n",

      "assessing the state of knowledge of the dangers of x-rays and radium, and issuing\n",
      "recommendations. Published in July 1921, the Committee report stated, in part:\n",
      "The danger of over exposure to x-rays and radium can be avoided by the provision of\n",
      "efficient protection and suitable working conditions. The known effects on the operator\n",
      "to be guarded against are: (1) Visible injuries to the superficial tissues which may result\n",
      "in permanent damage. (2) Derangements of the internal organs and changes in the blood.\n",
      "The following precautions are recommended:\n",
      "1. Not more than seven working hours a day.\n",
      "2. Sundays and two half-days off duty each week, to be spent as much as possible out of\n",
      "doors.\n",
      "3. An annual holiday of one month, or two separate fortnights.428\n",

      "during the past eight years, 90-130 mgm. [milligram] hours of gamma ray exposure to a\n",

      "to radium workers:\n",
      "The skin changes found in the earlier workers are not increasing, and are being avoided\n",
      "entirely by the younger ones, because of the increased knowledge, and increased\n",
      "protection… Complete protection can undoubtedly be obtained. It requires not only the\n",
      "means, but the continual caution on the part of the individual… Increased protection is\n",
      "needed by those who are working with gamma rays… Shortening the hours of work, and\n",

      "But Washington was not uniformly celebrated before his death. While he stayed neutral in political battles between the Federalists,\n",
      "represented by Alexander Hamilton, and Republicans such as Thomas Jefferson, the press still criticized him. Pro-Republican\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "The General Postcard Collection (GPCC) consists of sixteen boxes of picture postcards from the early twentieth\n",
      "century to the present day. Most are images of the Pittsburgh area but there are several boxes covering nearly\n",
      "every town and county in Pennsylvania. Office buildings, museums, parks, street scenes, skylines, theaters,\n",
      "schools, churches, factories, and more are memorialized, as well as highways, rivers, bridges, tunnels, railroad\n",
      "stations, historical images, and other less conventional scenes. Postcards have long been a popular way for\n",
      "businesses to advertise as well, and thus many “trade” cards are also included in the collection, from Heinz and\n",
      "Westinghouse to department stores, restaurants, and small family businesses.\n",
      "Soon after the U.S. Post Office authorized their use in 1898 and coinciding with the increasing popularity of\n",
      "photography, postcards were a convenient, inexpensive, and amusing way to send a small note along with a\n",
      "photo representing “home” to the recipient. They were printed and sold by postcard companies much as they\n",
      "are today, but anyone with a camera could also have their creations made into postcards for mailing. In this\n",
      "way, postcards document historical events. In addition to buildings, estates and institutions that no longer\n",
      "exist, there are postcards memorializing devastating floods and those that depict images of child labor or\n",
      "workers in mines, steel mills and glass factories. While photographs in any form are a useful source for the\n",
      "researcher, what makes postcards unique are often the personal messages they contain. A mother expresses\n",
      "concern for an ailing child, a friend hopes another will visit Pittsburgh soon, while another recommends a\n",
      "restaurant in which they recently ate -- postcards are not merely static images, they are poignant dynamic\n",
      "snapshots of a life now gone, with all of the joy and sadness that an ordinary life contains.\n",

      "Matthew Strauss: My name is Matthew Strauss, and we are recording an oral history\n",
      "here, at the Heinz History Center on Monday, July 27, 2015. I'm with Elsie Henderson,\n",
      "and her friend Kitty Paladin. And, we're going to be talking a little about Elsie's life and\n",
      "her career as a cook. So Elsie, could you tell us when and where you were born?\n",
      "Elsie Henderson: I was born up on Mount Washington, September 7, 1913.\n",
      "MS: And, is that where you grew up?\n",
      "EH: Yes, that was my hometown.\n",
      "MS: What was Mount Washington like in those days?\n",
      "EH: Well it seemed as those, everyone who lived there, everyone knew each other. The\n",
      "different families. And it was very close. Where I lived was on the famous, what they\n",
      "called William Street. And it was mostly Italian families there, and Negros. Everyone\n",
      "seemed to know each other.\n",
      "MS: And did you go to school in that neighborhood?\n",
      "EH: Yes, I went to; let me see, Cargo. And today they have changed it into a home for the\n",
      "elderly. On Boggs Avenue.\n",
      "MS: Did you like going to school?\n",
      "EH: I loved it. And from, it was called Cargo, and it was close to home. So I didn't have\n",
      "to walk very far.\n",
      "MS: Did you have many brothers and sisters?\n",
      "EH: Oh, don't ask (MS laughs). I was the youngest of thirteen. Eleven boys and two girls.\n",
      "So it was a very large family of youngsters.\n",
      "MS: And what was your parent's; what were their names?\n",
      "EH: My father died when I was two, so I have no recollection of him whatever. One thing\n",
      "for sure when the brothers, were grown up, my mother had a saying that, \"If you don't\n",
      "have a job, and are able to pay for your room and board, let the door knob hit you.\" You\n",
      "had to have something to do, or pay something toward your living, which made sense.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "MS: Did you have a job as child then?\n",
      "EH: Oh no, you know the only thing I seemed to be interested in was library. I had my\n",
      "card when I was six. And, what I loved from where we lived to Grandview Avenue, you\n",
      "know where you could look down on the city. I could go alone, and today, if you allow\n",
      "your children out, you may never see them again. It was a different time. And everyone\n",
      "knew everyone. So, it was [a] very pleasant place.\n",
      "MS: Now, growing up in Mount Washington, where did your family do most of its\n",
      "shopping?\n",
      "EH: Well, you've heard of Shiloh Street. Shiloh was the place where you shopped on\n",
      "weekends. You did your shopping, and the Shiloh ran right into Grandview, at the lower\n",
      "end. So Fridays and Saturdays, was shopping days on Shiloh Street. And there was a\n",
      "theater there, too. It was a big shopping area. Shiloh Street was the place to be on\n",
      "weekends, so.\n",
      "MS: You could walk to that part of town?\n",
      "EH: Yes. Walk. And be able to carry your groceries.\n",
      "MS: It's very important.\n",
      "EH: Yeah.\n",
      "MS: And, did you help your mother around the kitchen?\n",
      "EH: Well I enjoyed doing that because I figured I was a great help to her. And I\n",
      "mentioned all the times I was just in her way, you know. That's where I got my very first\n",
      "experience, in my mother's kitchen.\n",
      "MS: Can you remember some of the things that you cooked with your mother?\n",
      "EH: Well, things were, I'll say on the simple side. But one thing I do remember, our\n",
      "kitchen stove was like four burners. And then at that time, they made separate ovens, like\n",
      "a box, that if you had on your four burners, this thing sat right over the burners, and you\n",
      "could make an oven. That's what this was, a separate oven. So you always had, plenty of\n",
      "baking area. That was very nice.\n",
      "MS: And, when was it that you started cooking professionally?\n",
      "EH: Well, let me see. Do you know of the enormous, red building on the corner of\n",
      "Stevenson Street in the Mercy Hospital area? It takes up almost the whole block. And\n",
      "Mercy Hospital has a smaller building sort of adjoined to it on Stevenson Street. That was\n",
      "Kaufmann's building. That's where a lot of their commercial work was done, and all the\n",
      "packaging for the trucks, down in that huge basement, that's where Kaufmann's trucks\n",
      "were kept. And then on the first floor, you know years ago, they had a big sale, once a\n",
      "year. Kaufmann's was June. Like they have sales, now everyday. So, the first of June,\n",
      "every year, they would hire about eight black ladies, on this first floor to take care of this\n",
      "sale growth. And each one had a desk there. And as all of the packages and things came\n",
      "in, we kept records of everything. And then, underneath the first floor, was where\n",
      "Kaufmann's kept their trucks. In that building. And one thing about that, the work that we\n",
      "did, taking care of everything, in front of you there were enormous black boards, and\n",
      "each lady in there had their own separate board, and that was for the different areas. So\n",
      "someone might have; there might be two in the Squirrel Hill area, very wealthy, you\n",
      "know; and from time to time, they change, but your board is in front of you, and you\n",
      "know who everyone is on that board, that has an account at Kaufmann's. And you also\n",
      "know if they haven't paid their bill. You knew exactly who they were. So, let that be a\n",
      "lesson for you. Oh dear.\n",
      "Kitty Paladin: Let me interject a thought. Elsie, tell about when you wanted to be a\n",
      "nurse. And you went into nursing for a brief time.\n",
      "EH: Oh I'd thought, long, long years ago, I'd thought that I would like to be a nurse. So I\n",
      "went to, I'm trying to think of the name of the place. It was in Fourth Avenue, Downtown\n",
      "Pittsburgh. And my mother asked me, she said, \"Why are you doing that?” She said, “If\n",
      "you see a drop of blood, you fall on the floor.\" So I discovered, that nursing would not be\n",
      "for me, so I gave that up, but I did graduate. And I had my papers and everything, but I\n",
      "never used them. So that was a waste of time.\n",
      "MS: So you did graduate from nursing school?\n",
      "EH: Yes, I graduated. But never used it.\n",
      "KP: And then you went to work at Kaufmann's in the bad accounts department, didn't\n",
      "you?\n",
      "EH: Well, that's what I was talking about. That was bad accounts in that building on\n",
      "Forbes Street. So, I was there, for over six years, and that's when I became friendly with\n",
      "Edgar Kaufmann and his brothers, because the men from the store would come up to\n",
      "Forbes Street often. And that's where I first met Edgar, Sr. So when I went to\n",
      "Fallingwater, very first Saturday, when Kaufmanns came up for the weekend, Mr.\n",
      "Kaufmann came in and he was hollering. He said, \"I know this lady. I know this lady.\"\n",
      "And he said to me, he said, \"Elsie, you're going to like it better than you did in bad\n",
      "accounts.\" So I discovered that I did like it better. In fact, Fallingwater was the best place\n",
      "that I'd ever work in. And I've been around all of it.\n",
      "KP: Elsie, going back to your very early childhood, when your oldest brother Lewis, was\n",
      "in the war, do you want to tell about your remembrance?\n",
      "EH: Oh yes, that was the First World War.\n",
      "KP: First World War.\n",
      "EH: And when it was over, my oldest brother Lewis, came home, and I remember if it\n",
      "was just today, there were people that he wanted to visit, and from the back of our house,\n",
      "we could walk to this person's home, and I remember clearly, it was so muddy. And my\n",
      "mother had one hand, and my brother had the other. And we were walking down this\n",
      "muddy road to meet these people, who were so glad that my brother Lewis had come\n",
      "home in one piece. So.\n",
      "KP: That was around 1918, or 1919.\n",
      "EH: Whatever, and I was just six years old.\n",
      "KP: And she remembers.\n",
      "EH: You figure. I'm not good at figures.\n",
      "MS: So getting back to your career, you said you worked six years in the bad accounts\n",
      "division of Kaufmann's. So how did you make the transition from working in that office\n",
      "to cooking?\n",
      "EH: Well I'll tell you what happened. After the six years, there was a lady in Squirrel\n",
      "Hill, a white woman, who had an employment agency of her own. And she got help for\n",
      "just very wealthy people. And I had heard about her for a long time, so I says, \"I think I'll\n",
      "contact her. I know it won't do any good.\" But one day she called me. And she said,\n",
      "\"Elsie,\" she said, \"I have something that I'd think.\" And she put emphasis on \"think.\" \"I\n",
      "think you can do.\" She said it was for H. J. Heinz II. \"And he would like to talk to you.\"\n",
      "She set up the date for me to be at her office. And I sat there, and I'm waiting. And after a\n",
      "while Mr. Heinz sauntered in. He never walked. He had a kind of a switch with his\n",
      "bodyguard. And we talked for a while about different things, and then listen to this. When\n",
      "he was ready go, when it was decided that I would go to Rosemont Farm, he said, \"I\n",
      "promise you that when you come to Rosemont, you'll have a good time.\" That didn't\n",
      "sound right to me, because I'm raised with all of these boys who put me wise to\n",
      "everything. And I said, \"Well Mr. Heinz,” I said, “if you give me ample time off, I'll find\n",
      "my own pleasure.\" And he kind of reddened. He went out, but it was decided, that I\n",
      "would go to Rosemont Farms. The senator at that time was only five years old, Johnny.\n",
      "And you've been out there, and you know how that house is. The main section was for\n",
      "Mr. Heinz, and then the section on this side was for Johnny and his governess. And then,\n",
      "on the other side was the rooms for the staff. So everybody had their own section. But, at\n",
      "that time, Mr. Heinz and his wife were divorced, and if I remember, she had married\n",
      "someone into the army. Some big person. But before we get to that, I was there for about\n",
      "a week when Mr. Heinz's mother, and I have never been able to figure that was his aunt\n",
      "or his mother, from Moorewood Heights, you know above of Fifth Avenue. She came\n",
      "over, the first time I saw her, and she looked me up and down, she said, \"My,\" she says,\n",
      "\"you certainly are tiny.\" She says, \"Do you know how to make soup?\" I'm thinking\n",
      "myself, \"Oh Lord, here we go.\" I said, \"Yes, I know how to make soups, but I'd like to try\n",
      "different recipes, you know.\" She says, \"Well,\" very haughty, she says (EH imitates her\n",
      "voice), \"I'll send some of my recipes over to you,\" she says, \"because the canned soups\n",
      "are not for us. They are for the public.\" (EH's imitation ends) Oh dear, if she had known\n",
      "what I was thinking. That's how they got a lot of their money, from the public. But I\n",
      "discovered, that Rosemont Farms, was a good time place, when he said, \"You'll have a\n",
      "good time,\" it was a good time for people that wanted a good time. I never saw so many\n",
      "strange women in and out, and the laundress. We could never keep a laundress. And she\n",
      "came up one day, and whatever she was washing or ironing, she threw it on the floor, and\n",
      "she said, \"Elsie,\" she said, \"I am leaving today.\" She says, \"I'm not going to be washing\n",
      "after these women, who come in just to stay the night, or a few days.\" So I discovered\n",
      "that, when he said Rosemont Farms is a good time place, it was one of those places. And\n",
      "then, his mother knew about it, because every once in a while, she would call over there,\n",
      "and she said to me: \"Elsie is that woman still there?\" And I said, \"Yes she is.\" But what I\n",
      "didn't tell her, was that in the meantime, Kaufmann (note: EH most likely meant to say\n",
      "Heinz) had gone back to England and brought the woman's two children. I say the nice\n",
      "name I could give it, was a house of ill repute. So that's; I think I was there for a little\n",
      "over three years, when Johnny's mother sent for him to come to California. So I says,\n",
      "\"Well, my little friend is gone, so I'll think I'll go too.\" So I went to Ligonier, with very\n",
      "good friends of R. K. Mellon. You've probably heard of Taghshinny Farm? H.C.\n",
      "Bughman. Bughman was a president of a small railroad, and they had an enormous place\n",
      "-- barns, and men to work the farm and everything. And so I was there. The husband,\n",
      "H.C. Bughman, was a very good friend of R. K. Mellon. And he was the master of\n",
      "Rolling Rock. H.C. Bughman. And you know, starting in the fall, when those horse\n",
      "shows, what is it? I'm trying to think. The Rolling Rock Club, you know the hunters that\n",
      "would start about in October. When they had dates set up, you never seen so many dogs,\n",
      "and horses, riders and everything. And everybody's feeling pretty good. They had a drink\n",
      "before they go out, and I wondered to myself, \"That's so dangerous to be drinking at a\n",
      "hunt.\" You know. But, that was their lives. So H.C. Bughman was the master of the\n",
      "Rolling Rock hunt, and he and R. K. Mellon were just like this (sound of putting her\n",
      "hands together). So. I was there for, I'm trying to think how long, but I'll tell you what\n",
      "happened. Oh, there was the Bughman's had a staff. There was one lady, a white woman,\n",
      "who had; she helped with the cleaning at Taghshinny Farm. And she said to me, she said,\n",
      "\"You know Elsie, R. K. Mellon is trying to run all the people off of the place he's buying\n",
      "them out.\" And she said they have tried to buy her farm. She said, \"But Mellon would\n",
      "never have enough money to buy them out,\" because they wouldn't sell to him, because\n",
      "their farm had been in her family for over two hundred years. And she was one who\n",
      "never sold to Mellon. I said, \"Thank you.\" Because they had probably just taken over the\n",
      "town. You know? So.\n",
      "MS: Did you feel growing up in a working-class neighborhood; what was it like for you\n",
      "to go to work for these very wealthy families?\n",
      "EH: Well, listen, I'll tell ya, in my youth, like eight and ten years old, I spent a lot of time\n",
      "with my grandmother. In Front Royal, Virginia. And, up the road from her was another\n",
      "relative, and this little girl and I we were practically brought up together, because we\n",
      "spent so much time together. And my grandmother would sit us down and give us the\n",
      "whole history of everything. And she said, \"If you can avoid it, whatever you do, never\n",
      "do housework for white folks. Find something that maybe, is your own.\" So that's what I\n",
      "did. And when we were there, down at the end of my grandmother's road, there was a\n",
      "white man who had a grocery store, and I don't know how they made it, but they had the\n",
      "best peach ice cream, you've ever tasted. And every once in a while my grandmother\n",
      "would let us go down to the store. And, she would tell us what to do, and when we got\n",
      "ready to leave; [She said,] \"when you come back up the road, if you pass any white folks,\n",
      "you step aside,\" and she would show us what to do. And while we're in this store, there's\n",
      "white people come into shop, and they turn around and they look at you like your dirt,\n",
      "and even if they're the biggest things down there, they talk funny. And they say, \"Who's\n",
      "these?\" And the owner says, \"These Bird Jeffery grandchildren from up in Pittsburgh.\"\n",
      "And they're looking at you like your poison or something, and then my grandmother says,\n",
      "\"When you come back up the road, if you pass any white folks\" she said, \"You stoop like\n",
      "this. Step aside and you let them pass.\" Can you see me stepping' aside now for\n",
      "somebody?\n",
      "MS: Pittsburgh at that time; was that something you had to think about, when you're in\n",
      "Pittsburgh; relations between.\n",
      "EH: Yes, we had that since the world began. And we'll have it until He comes. So things\n",
      "are a little better, but they never will be like they should be. But I'll tell you one thing\n",
      "about being at Fallingwater, out of all the people, you know when the parents died, Junior\n",
      "Kaufmann, just about; what people don't know, he just about turned that house over to\n",
      "me. And there was talk going around the town, the two most important people at\n",
      "Fallingwater are Jess Hall, who was the superintendent, and Elsie C. Lee; that was my\n",
      "name at that time. But I tell you, out of all the years that I was at Fallingwater, I only met\n",
      "two people who were racist bigots. I mean guests. But up there, there was two white\n",
      "ladies, and one of them, her name was Elsie, too; and I tell you how she came to\n",
      "Fallingwater. Young Kaufmann, he took over, he said, \"It's yours do whatever you want\n",
      "to do.\" And he says, \"Do you think you're going hire someone else?\" He said, \"Let's get\n",
      "someone else in.\" And there was a woman by the name of Harbaugh, Elsie Harbaugh.\n",
      "And, when Mr. Kaufmann, Junior Kaufmann, interviewed her, it wasn't at Fallingwater,\n",
      "he said didn't want her in his house until he found out whether or not she cared for black\n",
      "folks. And so he interviewed this Elsie Harbaugh, at Jess Hall's house, and Jess Hall's\n",
      "wife, he's the superintendent. And his wife and I were like twins. And they were in a new\n",
      "house that Kaufmann had built for them. It was like a ranch house, but it's open, no doors.\n",
      "And so his wife and I were such good friends. And Mr. Kaufmann asked her if he could\n",
      "interview this Elsie Harbaugh up at her place. And she said, \"Yes.\" She knew Elsie\n",
      "because they belonged to the same church. So, Elsie met Mr. Kaufmann at the\n",
      "Harbaughs, and his wife was sitting close by, but there were no doors in this; it was all\n",
      "like open. And she was sitting; she could hear everything that was being said. And she\n",
      "told me, she said, \"The first thing the Junior Kaufmann said to this Elise Harbaugh is 'Do\n",
      "you have any objections to working with colored people?' And Elsie said 'No, no indeed.'\n",
      "He said, 'Well I'm glad at that' he said 'because if you did,” he said, “I wouldn't want you\n",
      "on my property.'\" That's how the Kaufmanns felt about. So Elsie was hired, and here's the\n",
      "thing: Every Monday, you'd get a letter, from the downtown office, telling you if there's\n",
      "going to be guest for the weekend or not, who they are, and if they have any funny quirks\n",
      "or anything. We always know what's going on, I know how to do the meals. And\n",
      "everything then. And what I'm going to order and make up my menus, if someone's going\n",
      "to have guests. But if we didn't have a guest, sometimes I wouldn't see Kaufmanns for\n",
      "two or three months at a time, but your money keeps rolling. Which is good. But I got to\n",
      "the point, where I felt that I'm taking money for nothing, and I asked Mrs. Kaufmann,\n",
      "when they are away for such a long time, if one of their drivers, would take me up, say\n",
      "like on a Wednesday, and there was a lot I could get done. I could make my ice creams,\n",
      "or do baking. And that's what I would do. But, when the letters came out, the guest list,\n",
      "sometimes Mister Kaufmann Junior would look at it, and one time he hit the ceiling,\n",
      "because when the letter came out, he had Elsie Harbaugh's name ahead of mine. Just\n",
      "something like that. Harbaugh instead of Lee. And the office changed it and put Elsie\n",
      "Lee. Oh dear.\n",
      "MS: So getting back to the beginning of your Fallingwater experience. Can you tell us\n",
      "how you got that job, cooking for the Kaufmanns?\n",
      "EH: Well when I was Ligonier, with the Taghshinny Farm, I happened to be looking at\n",
      "the paper one day. And I read the Want Ads, and here's this ad, and I said, \"This reads too\n",
      "good to be true.\" I said, \"It just cannot be.\" I just says, \"I'm going to look into this.\" And\n",
      "when I looked into it, it was Lillian Kaufmann. And the first thing she said to me, she\n",
      "said, \"Well, can you come into be measured?\" And I said, \"Measured for what?\" When\n",
      "you were at Fallingwater, say for instance, I'm going to where a uniform today. It had to\n",
      "be costumed made. That's how important they were about doing things right. So, I went\n",
      "to Fallingwater, which I have never regretted. All the others, they're really not worth\n",
      "mentioning.\n",
      "MS: What made that so special?\n",
      "EH: Because they knew how to treat people. One thing that was nice, and it was very\n",
      "unusual. Mr. Kaufmann's hobby was passing out hundred-dollar bills, so that's nice. Up to\n",
      "the point, where when it was against the law, to have money in a safe deposit box, I had\n",
      "one, because I had as much as five-thousand dollars in there. So you're not going to turn\n",
      "that in as salary. And I only got rid of my safe deposit box, about six months ago. So, tell\n",
      "him why I did.\n",
      "KP: I don't know.\n",
      "EH: I should've kept the safe deposit box.\n",
      "KP: For your future winnings.\n",
      "EH: No, I'll tell you about the figures. I was at a grocery store. This was the first of\n",
      "December, this past year. And there was two lines there. And I'm in the wrong line,\n",
      "because I was going to buy postage stamps. And when I got to the window the lady said,\n",
      "\"Oh, you're in the wrong line.\" She says, \"This is the numbers. People play numbers.\"\n",
      "KP: Lottery line.\n",
      "EH: The lottery line. Yeah. So I said, \"Well I'll tell you what,\" I says, \"Since I'm here\n",
      "give me a dollar ticket.\" She said, \"Which one do you want?\" I says, \"I don't know.\" I\n",
      "said, \"I've heard something about it. What is there a Treasure Hunt?\" She says, \"Oh, yes.\"\n",
      "So I got that ticket, and I glanced at it. And I got home, and I laid it down, and I was\n",
      "watching TV, that evening, and when they bring the number on, I just happened to look\n",
      "at it, and I said, \"Some of those numbers look familiar.\" And I looked around for my\n",
      "ticket, and there was close to fifty-three thousand dollars.\n",
      "MS: Wow!\n",
      "EH: On that.\n",
      "MS: You won?\n",
      "EH: Yeah!\n",
      "MS: Wow!\n",
      "EH: I say this can't be. And I called some of my relatives who are very highly educated,\n",
      "and everything. I told them, I says, \"Come over here I want you to see something.\" And\n",
      "they came over and he said, \"Yes Elsie you got fifty-three thousand dollars on this\n",
      "tickets.\" In the wrong line. And here's the thing, the numbers on this ticket were all in\n",
      "sequence.\n",
      "MS: Really? They just gave you a sequence of numbers?\n",
      "EH: Yes!\n",
      "MS: That's some luck.\n",
      "EH: Oh my. And the manager in our office, I said, \"I'll have to tell them about it. This\n",
      "might have something to do with my housing thing.\" She said, \"Elsie,\" she said; she's the\n",
      "type of person who will do anything for you. And she said, \"Elise,\" she said, \"I've been to\n",
      "this place before where you have to go.\" She said, \"I'll take you.\" And so she took me in;\n",
      "it was enormous place, and they have people who have won the lottery. Their pictures are\n",
      "all over the place. She said, \"Do you want your picture?\" \"NO! No, no, no.\" So we were\n",
      "there I guess for over an hour. And then they give you a booklet. It's huge. It tells you all\n",
      "about everything, your winning, and everything. And it says, it would take about four to\n",
      "six weeks before everything was straightened out. But mine was about four weeks. And\n",
      "they sent me a big fat check.\n",
      "KP: I have a question for Elsie. Elsie, you know the Kaufmanns were so wealthy. They\n",
      "had many houses and apartments. Tell about the time, when Mr. Kaufmann, was in the\n",
      "William Penn Hotel, where they had an apartment, and he invited the mayor in. Mayor\n",
      "Lawrence.\n",
      "EH: No let me see. They were up on the fifteenth floor, of the William Penn. Huge\n",
      "apartment. I think you're talking about time I was going in Kaufmann's Department store.\n",
      "And I happened to look down the street, and there was a, I'm trying to think who this was.\n",
      "KP: This was the time when Mayor Lawrence, came about the Civic Arena that Mr.\n",
      "Kaufmann complained about.\n",
      "EH: Oh yes. The talk was that Mr. Kaufmann had given over a million dollars toward the\n",
      "arena, but when they opened, they wouldn't hire blacks. That's what he was upset about.\n",
      "And there's something else involved with that. Trying to think.\n",
      "KP: Well he invited Mayor Lawrence, and he complained to Mayor Lawrence, because\n",
      "they weren't—\n",
      "EH: Yes, but after he talked to Mayor Lawrence, then they started hiring blacks at the\n",
      "arena. And then, their winter property was in Palm Springs, California. And when they\n",
      "would go away for the winter, Mrs. Kaufmann, said to me one day. She said, \"Elsie,”\n",
      "someone had to babysit their apartment. No one there. And different ones on the staff\n",
      "would take three or four days and stay down there. She said, \"Elsie there's just one thing.\"\n",
      "She said, \"When we're away,” she says, “if you're here for your three or four days, or\n",
      "whatever.\" She says, \"It would be nice if you would have your mother come down and\n",
      "stay with you for your time.\" She said, \"But there's just one thing,\" she said, \"If your\n",
      "mother comes down,” she said, “I want her to sleep in my bedroom.\" I said, \"What's\n",
      "wrong with ours?\" So my mother came down from Terrace Village, where she lived, and\n",
      "she stayed for a close to three days, I believe, and I went in one day, and she is putting\n",
      "her things back in the suitcase. I said, \"Mom,” I said, “what are you doing?\" She said,\n",
      "\"I'm going back to Terrace Village, where I belong.\" She said, \"This is too much for me.\"\n",
      "And I said, \"Don't you enjoy sleeping on sheets that cost, how much? A hundred and\n",
      "sixty-five dollars a dozen.\" My mother says, \"That's the problem!\" She says, \"This is too\n",
      "much. You don't even make ice water. You have ice water coming out of the spicket.\" So\n",
      "my mother went home. She says, \"I will write to Mrs. Kaufmann and thank her for\n",

      "KP: A human-interest story. What about the time the Kaufmanns were leaving, and all\n",
      "the help referred to them as--?\n",
      "EH: Oh yes. Over the years, we called them \"Ma and Pa\" behind their backs, you know.\n",
      "But if they were going some place and were going to be away for a while, all of the help\n",
      "would meet at the William Penn to have champagne and bid them adieu. It was just\n",
      "something. So they're leaving, and they're going to be gone for a while, and the men are\n",
      "taking out all the luggage and everything. There was a woman there who wore a beautiful\n",

      "MS: How involved were the Kaufmanns with what you were cooking?\n",
      "EH: Oh no, Mrs. Kaufmann. She said, \"We had the best people all the time.” She said,\n",
      "“How could I tell you what to prepare.\" She said, \"You are the cook here.\" And they had\n",
      "a chef and had a kitchen maid. And I was always informed, \"Elsie you're not to do\n",

      "KP: And Elsie you kept track of the guests and what they were eating?\n",
      "EH: Yes. Say for instance you were our guest this weekend. Of course, my menus,\n",

      "MS: Did you keep a recipe book?\n",
      "EH: Oh yes. All of my recipes. Each year I would start a new book. And let me tell you\n",
      "what happened. When my husband died, I was in the beautiful five-bedroom house of my\n",
      "own huge place, and I had taken all of these books from year after year and put them on a\n",

      "EH: Oh lord, I don't know. I don't remember dates. But let me tell you one thing. Another\n",

      "Avenue side, I happened to look down Fifth Avenue. And there's a real tall man there,\n",
      "and I said, \"Oh that's John Heinz.” And I said, “If he's still there I'll speak to him.\" So\n",

      "Pittsburgh. Very important, very high. But when I was talking to Heinz, this man had his\n",

      "the top men from Fallingwater always comes over to give me a little moral support. And,\n",
      "he told me, he said, \"Elsie,\" he says, \"your bedroom is now my office.\" So I said, \"Well\n",
      "you got a nice office.\"\n",
      "KP: To clarify that. The Mennonite Center is a retreat center, that Rhodes Scholars has a\n",
      "meeting every year when they study architecture, including Fallingwater. So it has\n",
      "nothing do with Fallingwater, necessarily. Elsie why don't you tell him about some of the\n",
      "people that came to Fallingwater.\n",
      "EH: Oh, the main thing, while I'm thinking about it. When young Kaufmann passed\n",
      "away, they asked me to be there to receive the hundred and twenty-five people that were\n",
      "at his service. His memorial service at Fallingwater. So I was there. Oh my. It was a very\n",
      "sad time, and who must be there but Mrs. Hagan. The Hagans and the Kaufmanns were\n",
      "like this. But I hadn't seen Mrs. Hagan for a long time. And she said, \"Elsie,\" she said,\n",
      "\"you did a wonderful job today. Accepting all those people for the memorial service.\"\n",
      "And I didn't know she passed away not too long ago.\n",
      "KP: Mrs. Hagan lived in Kentuck Knob that Frank Lloyd Wright designed in the fifties.\n",
      "After Fallingwater.\n",
      "EH: And when you're in the back of Kentuck, you like look down into a valley. And that\n",
      "house down is where, who was the man who, I'm trying to think of his name. The man\n",
      "who bought Kentuck Knob, the Englishman. You know who I’m talking about?\n",
      "KP: Mr. Palumbo?\n",
      "EH: Palumbo. Lord Palumbo. Yes he bought Kentuck. And he always stays in that big\n",
      "house that you look down on. But you could put Kentuck inside of Fallingwater.\n",
      "KP: You met Frank Lloyd Wright.\n",
      "EH: Well, I'm trying to think of the year that Fallingwater was flooded. And the water\n",
      "came up to the sofa. The son was home that weekend. And we had to run for our lives up\n",
      "to the guesthouse. So we went up there. That's when he decided to have Frank Lloyd\n",
      "Wright to come in. It took him over two months, I believe to get that cleaned out and in\n",
      "pretty good shape. And then he said, he was going to have Frank Lloyd Wright come in\n",
      "to talk to some of the men on the property. And he said he wanted the men standing there,\n",
      "when Mr. Wright came in. We don't want to keep Mr. Wright waiting. And he said,\n",
      "\"Elsie, if you will go to the airport with his top man.\" So we went, and Mr. Wright came\n",
      "out. When he stepped in the car, he said, \"Well young lady,\" he said, \"What do you do at\n",
      "Fallingwater?\" I said, \"Well I plan the meals and do the baking.\" And when he stepped\n",
      "[into the] car he said, \"Well,” he said, “If the food is as good as you look.\" He's kind of\n",
      "fresh, you know. I thought to myself, \"that's why he was in so much trouble with so many\n",
      "women.\" (Laugh). But he wanted to come through Oakland to see what he called the\n",

      "a big building that still has the store's name on it. What is the? It was only rich people got\n",

      "someplace. Nobody else would talk to me. They were so afraid of getting something of\n",

      "there near Christmas time.\n",
      "KP: What about Mrs. Kaufmann's dachshunds? The dogs. And how were they fed?\n",
      "EH: Oh yes. Don't want to forget about them. Mrs. Kaufmann’s crazy about the\n",
      "dachshunds. And all of their names began with an \"M.\" And when I first saw them, I\n",
      "asked them, \"How can you tell them apart. They all look the same.\" But you know, when\n",
      "you come to know them, they're just like people. They have their personalities. And the\n",

      "any better, have Jones fly him out.” He said, “I think the sunshine will do him good.\"\n",

      "EH: Oh yes. We had a man. He died about three years ago. That leaves me the only one\n",
      "in all that [unclear]. Simon Burnworth, who was born and raised up there in Fayette\n",
      "County. And his job, I think, Fallingwater, was the only job he ever had. He came there,\n",
      "and he died up there, three or four years ago. When he came in the morning, he would\n",
      "stop at the greenhouse. And they had rooms there. One room for dogs' frozen roasted beef\n",
      "and then I had room there for everything that was put up. And let me see, Simon, when\n",
      "he came in in the morning, he would stop at the greenhouse, and get the roasted beef for\n",
      "the dogs. He would come down and put that on. And cook it slowly, while that is on, he\n",
      "would go through the whole house, and check every room to see if there was a leak in the\n",
      "windows. And then, he would feed the dogs later on. And then before he left, about four,\n",
      "or five he would recheck every room in Fallingwater, again, before he left. So there\n",
      "wouldn't be any leaks or anything wrong, he would know about it. So there was the only\n",

      "though she doesn't speak to me,” I says, “I'll go up to see what's happening.\" So I went\n",
      "up, and she was in bed. She was moaning, \"Uh! Call Ethel! Call Joan!\" She moaned\n",
      "everyone. I said, \"I can only call one. Do you want your mother?\" \"Yes!\" She's speaking\n",
      "to me now. So I called over there, what they call the big house. And the mother, this is\n",
      "first time I saw Rose, when she came over. Shall I show him what she did? (EH laughs)\n",
      "KP: Um-hum.\n",
      "EH: She came in the backdoor, and she got close to me. She did this. Look me up and\n",
      "down like I'm dirt. She never said \"Good morning,\" or \"Kiss my behind,\" or anything. I'm\n",
      "thinking to myself, \"This is the great Rose Kennedy. Who goes to church every day. All\n",
      "this money and everything, but no manners.\" And Shriver, they came up one weekend,\n",
      "and I asked his bodyguard, I said, \"What happened to your folks last week? We were\n",
      "expecting you?\" And the man says to me, well, he says, \"I know you won't say anything,\"\n",
      "He says, \"When Shriver is expected up here with Eunice, and he doesn't show up,\" he\n",
      "says, \"He makes certain that Eunice is there. And then he has women live in with him\n",
      "over the weekend.\" I'm telling you they are really something.\n",
      "KP: But you have wonderful things, in memory about Mrs. Ethel Kennedy?\n",
      "EH: Oh Ethel. Ethel is the nicest one in that family. She had a woman who had been with\n",
      "her for close to twenty years. And I met her, and I was over at Ethel's several times. And\n",
      "this woman, she thought that her health was failing, and one day she said to Ethel. She\n",
      "said, she thought she should go into a nursing home. And Ethel put her hands on her hips,\n",
      "and she says, \"Nina,\" she says, \"When you die,\" she says, \"You'll die in my house.\" And\n",
      "that's exactly what happened. And Ethel brought all of her relatives from all over into\n",
      "Hyannis. And put them up into a hotel, until after the funeral. And Ethel's sons were\n",
      "pallbearers. Ethel was like the Kaufmanns.\n",
      "KP: When Edgar Junior invited you to New York sometime. And he had an apartment\n",
      "house there. There were some very prominent people who lived at that apartment.\n",
      "EH: Oh yes. I'll tell you where he was. He was at 450 East 52nd Street across the street\n",
      "from the River Club that did not allow Jews in there. And guess who's been in there for\n",
      "years now? What's his name? I can't think of his name. His big in Jew and politics, but\n",
      "he's been in there for years now. So they changed their policy long time ago. I can't think\n",
      "of his name. Oh dear. And, I would go several times to New York, when young\n",
      "Kaufmann had very important people coming. And, I'm still trying to think of this man's\n",
      "name. And young Kaufmann said to me, he said, \"Here over cross the street at the River\n",
      "Club, no Jews, and no blacks, could even work there.\" Henry Kissinger, he's been in there\n",
      "for years. Yeah, Kissinger, Henry Kissinger; he's pretty well up in age now is he?\n",
      "KP: But, two prominent actors lived there?\n",
      "EH: Well, when I would go over, this huge apartment house at 450 East 52nd Street is\n",
      "directly across from the River Club, and I discovered young Kaufmann owned the\n",
      "building. And all of his tenants were big time people. All the movie stars, had apartments\n",
      "there. I'm trying to think of what some of the names.\n",
      "KP: Well, Greta Garbo.\n",
      "EH: Greta Garbo, lived there. And Mary Martin. There was a whole host of very famous.\n",
      "KP: And that was the time when she was really in South Pacific, and in Sound of Music.\n",
      "EH: Yeah.\n",
      "KP: So Mr. Kaufmann must have known her well.\n",
      "EH: And then he would say to me, \"Elsie, do you want to go shopping, before you go\n",
      "back home?\" And I said, \"Yes. I'm too well raised to refuse.\" So I said, \"Give me your\n",
      "charge card.\" He said, \"Elsie,\" he said, \"you've been around here for ages.\" He said, \"You\n",
      "know where everything is.\" Which I did, because I'm looking into everything. So I would\n",
      "go to Bergdorf Goodman's or Bomitella [?]. And, when I'm just walking around, looking\n",
      "there's, some of the sales people in there, they're looking at me. They think I'm going to\n",
      "steal something, you know. Until one of them got on my nerves, so I asked her, I says,\n",
      "\"Can I help you?\" But I really didn't want anything, but I'd buy a little something. You\n",
      "know. And then when I showed them Edgar Kaufmann's charge cards, the attitude\n",
      "changed. They eat me up. I said, \"Why are people like that?\" Of course, I know why\n",
      "they're like that. (EH Laughs)\n",
      "KP: You know, is it clear that you didn't live at Fallingwater? It was only their weekend\n",
      "residence, and that's when you were there Elsie, just for weekends right?\n",
      "EH: Oh just weekends. And the good thing about that is, sometimes you wouldn't see\n",
      "Kaufmanns for weeks and weeks at a time, but your money keeps rolling.\n",
      "KP: What about the time when the people from England came. And they were so\n",
      "complimentary.\n",
      "EH: Oh well, young Kaufmann got to the point that he wasn't at home, at all. He said,\n",
      "\"Elise you've been around here a hundred years. It's yours.\" So he says, \"But next week\n",
      "were having very important people from England.\" He said, \"But I won't be here.\" I said,\n",
      "\"As usual,\" because it's easier for me to talk to him, than it is to talk to you. And I almost\n",
      "had a heart attack, when he told me who they were. It was the equerry and lady-in-\n",
      "waiting to Queen Elizabeth. So, they came and I had them for five days, because I have\n",
      "all the help that I need, and my other Elsie, you know, she's still there. And then there's\n",
      "always another woman that I can depend on. If I can't get there in time, they know how I\n",
      "love the salads done. They know how to do it. And, I had them for five days, and the top\n",
      "chauffer was there, and we took them all around Fayette County. And when they got\n",
      "ready to leave, you know their accent? The lady-in-waiting says (imitating English\n",
      "accent), \"Oh this it’s a marvelous town. \" She says, \"We don't have this kind of service in\n",
      "Buckingham Palace.\" (End imitation English accent). I said \"Oh Lord!\"\n",
      "MS: That's quite a compliment.\n",
      "EH: Oh dear. I tell you another famous guest we had there. The birdman, what was his\n",
      "name?\n",
      "KP: It wasn't Audubon it's the other one. I can't remember.\n",
      "EH: I can't think of it, but when he was there, you couldn't get in there for television\n",
      "people, who came to Fallingwater to interview him. I can't think of his name.\n",
      "KP: Yes, he was invited for a week to do his paintings. And have a rest. What was his\n",
      "name?\n",
      "EH: And, let me see.\n",
      "KP: Well you know Einstein was there one time.\n",
      "EH: Who?\n",
      "KP: Einstein came there. But not while you were there.\n",
      "EH: But that was before my time.\n",
      "KP: Before your time.\n",
      "EH: There were a lot of them that were before my time. This Frida Kahlo, wasn't she a\n",
      "Spanish or something?\n",
      "MS: Mexican, I think.\n",
      "KP: She was the wife of Diego Rivera, is it? Yeah.\n",
      "EH: Who was the world famous violinist?\n",
      "KP: Yes, he was there.\n",
      "EH: What was his name?\n",
      "KP: He's contemporary violinist. I know you know it.\n",
      "EH: I'm trying to think.\n",
      "KP: Couldn't remember it. Write it down. Anyway, maybe you'll think of it. But you\n",
      "know, the Kaufmann's were so generous. And remember how they even had a building\n",
      "for their women employees. On Fallingwater property, before Fallingwater was built.\n",
      "EH: There was a name for it. But listen, their head gardener, had been with them for, oh I\n",
      "don't know, how many years. But, at vacation time, he went somewhere to visit his\n",
      "daughter, and he passed away there. He had been with Kaufmanns for almost thirty years.\n",
      "And they're upset because what are they going to do about a gardener. They finally found\n",
      "a man. I believe he was from Ohio. And he said he was ready to come, when Kaufmanns\n",
      "were ready for him. And Junior says, \"They could stay in the guest house.\" No, Mr.\n",
      "Kaufmann said they could stay in the guesthouse. And Junior put his foot down and said,\n",
      "\"No!\" He said, \"Let them wait, until I build a house for them.\" So the weekends that\n",
      "young Kaufmann came to Fallingwater, you couldn't walk in the living room, because he\n",
      "and Paul Mayén had all these things laying out on the floor, designed for the house you\n",
      "know. So they built the house. It was about two months, and Mr. Kaufmann said, \"Put\n",
      "this new man on salary.\" But he didn't want him on the property. Let him wait until he\n",
      "built a house. And he's on salary. George Greene, his name was. So when the house was\n",
      "ready, he and his wife they came. And, she had charge of all of my jelly making, because\n",
      "I'm not a jelly person. Mrs. Greene was; that was what she did. And when the house was\n",
      "flooded, I guess maybe, a couple weeks before, she had placed all of her jellies in the\n",
      "basement. And all of that had to be thrown out, because the water was up to the ceiling in\n",
      "the basement. What a waste.\n",
      "MS: Well thank you so much for chatting with us today. Do you have any other\n",
      "questions, Kitty?\n",
      "KP: Um…well an interesting thing about Pittsburgh, which is what we're here for, is\n",
      "because the Kaufmanns were Jewish, they weren't permitted to be in the country clubs,\n",
      "certainly the Duquesne Clubs. So do you think that's a reason for them to want to go way\n",
      "out to Mill Valley, sixty miles away from Pittsburgh to have their weekend retreat?\n",
      "EH: Well there was a limit to where Jews and blacks could go. You weren't allowed at\n",
      "all. But let me tell you, when my book came out, Suzanne, you know Suzanne Martin.\n",
      "She come, and she says \"Elsie,\" she says, \"There are some women from the Washington\n",
      "Post. Washington, D.C., that want to meet you, and they're coming to Pittsburgh. And\n",
      "they are going to be at the Duquesne Club.\" And I said, \"No, no, no.\" She said, \"Elsie\n",
      "that's all changed now. Blacks are allowed to work there and be there, you know.\" So I\n",
      "said, \"Well, I'll tell you what, I haven't asked them to allow me to come. They have asked\n",
      "me. So, I'll go.\" So we had a big luncheon there, and these women from the Washington\n",
      "Post, they were in Pittsburgh. The menu, you've never seen such a menu. But anyhow,\n",
      "when I look around I'm the only dark face in the Duquesne Club. And when the affair\n",
      "was over, just before it was over, there was some woman from Sewickley Heights, came\n",
      "up to me with the biggest bowl of flowers I've ever seen. And the only way, I could get it\n",
      "home, Suzanne Martin's husband, who was alive then, and he carried it.\n",
      "MS: You received a lot attention for that wonderful cookbook?\n",
      "EH: Yes, from '08. \"The Best Cookbook In Pittsburgh.\" \"The Best Cookbook in Europe.\"\n",
      "It won the Gourmand Award that they give out once a year. You got those papers. I said,\n",
      "\"I think I've just about send everything to you, but you can't walk in my apartment. And\n",
      "if I come across other things, that I haven't send, I'll send.\"\n",
      "MS: Good to know thank you.\n",
      "KP: Well a question, that's rather interesting. Elsie, do you remember the Depression?\n",
      "You know, you were only thirteen, sixteen; in your teenage years. That would have\n",
      "affected not only your family, but everybody's family. But particularly yours. Do you\n",
      "remember anything about it?\n",
      "EH: I don't remember.\n",
      "KP: Pretty early in life.\n",
      "MS: Is there anything else we haven't talked about, that you'd like to add?\n",
      "EH: I'm trying to think. I think we've covered most, and I signed that; what you sent to\n",

      "Compote is a jelly or jam-like spread that can be served over vanilla ice cream,\n",
      "pancakes, or waffles. It was regularly paired with ice cream on the Augusta Victoria\n",
      "in the time period Nellie travelled.\n",
      "Ingredients\n",
      "1 pound fresh or frozen fruit of your choice (you can try blueberries, raspberries, peaches, or\n",
      "your favorite fruit!)\n",
      "2 Tablespoons honey or maple syrup\n",
      "Dash of salt\n",
      "Instructions\n",
      "If you’re using fresh strawberries or peaches, cut them into thin slices. If you’re using blueberries\n",
      "or raspberries, you can use them whole. Frozen fruit doesn’t need to be defrosted.\n",
      "In a medium saucepan, combine your fruit of choice, the honey or the maple syrup, and a dash\n",
      "of salt. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. This will take\n",
      "about 5 minutes for fresh fruit or 10 minutes for frozen fruit.\n",
      "After it's boiling, reduce the heat to medium. If you’re using chunky fruit or prefer a smoother\n",
      "consistency, mash the fruit with a potato masher or serving fork until it reaches the consistency\n",
      "you want.\n",
      "Keep the compote mixture simmering for about 5 minutes or when it is about half of its original\n",
      "size. Stir it frequently.\n",
      "Remove the compote from the heat.\n",
      "Let the compote cool for a few minutes before you serve it. Allow leftover compote to cool\n",
      "completely before covering and refrigerating. You can keep it for up to 10 days.\n",

      "Instructions\n",

      "Measure and prepare the garlic, ginger, serrano pepper (optional), garam masala, coriander, cumin, turmeric, and\n",
      "black pepper. Add them into saucepan and sauté the curry mixture for 1 more minute.\n",
      "Prepare the broth, crushed tomatoes, potatoes, cauliflower, and carrots. Add them into the saucepan, then stir the\n",
      "curry mixture a few times.\n",
      "Add the green beans and simmer the curry mixture for an additional 10-12 minutes until the vegetables have\n",
      "reached your desired tenderness. Stir the curry mixture occasionally.\n",
      "Add the chickpeas, stir them in, and sauté for 1 minute. Add a little bit of water to the pot if the curry mixture\n",
